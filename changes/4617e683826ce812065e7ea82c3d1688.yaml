desc: Updated the ``Snap._applyNodeEdits()`` API to require a caller to provide the
  ``user`` value in the ``meta`` argument. One remote API endpoint, ``ViewApi.saveNodeEdits()``,
  previously allowed the ``meta`` argument to be provided without the ``user`` value.
  This API now requires the ``user`` value provided as well.
