desc: Added support to the Oauth2 providers to use ``client_assertion`` values to
  authenticate to Oauth2 endpoints. These can be used instead of providing a
  ``client_secret`` value if the OAuth2 provider supports ``client_assertion``
  authentication. This update includes support for obtaining the assertion values
  via user defined Storm callbacks; as well as obtaining the assertions from
  Azure Managed Identity Workloads.
