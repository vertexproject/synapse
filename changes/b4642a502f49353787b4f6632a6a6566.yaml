desc: Fixed an issue with the Storm loop and generator keywords, ``continue``, ``break``,
  and ``stop``. Using these keywords to outside of a loop or generator function will now raise a ``StormRuntimeError``
  exception. Using these keywords to tear down the Storm runtime will now emit an
  ``err`` message with the type ``StormRuntimeError`` and a message indicating the
  invalid use of the keywords.
