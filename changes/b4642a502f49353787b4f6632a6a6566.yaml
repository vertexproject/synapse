desc: Fixed an issue with the Storm loop and generator keywords, ``continue``, ``break``,
  and ``stop``. Using these keywords outside of a loop or generator function will now
  raise a ``StormRuntimeError`` exception. Using these keywords to tear down the Storm
  runtime will now emit an ``err`` message with the type ``StormRuntimeError`` and a
  message indicating the invalid use of the keywords.
