desc: Migrate invalid ``it:sec:cpe`` nodes if possible. Migration of these nodes
  will only be successful if one of the CPE 2.3 (primary property) or the CPE
  2.2 (``:v2_2``) strings are valid CPEs.  If both CPE strings are invalid, the
  node will be removed from the cortex and stored in a queue
  (``model_0_2_31:nodes``). All references to these invalid nodes will also be
  removed and stored in a separate queue (``model_0_2_31:nodes:refs``).

  The structure of items in these queues are opaque. The intent is for Power-Ups
  to be able to process these queues in an attempt to fix the invalid nodes on a
  per Power-Up basis (the idea being that Power-Up data vendors probably make
  the same mistake consistently).

  During migration or removal of invalid ``it:sec:cpe`` nodes, referencing nodes
  with readonly properties will be removed and stored in the
  ``model_0_2_31:nodes:refs`` queue. We are unable to automatically migrate
  these nodes due to the dynamic nature of their construction.
