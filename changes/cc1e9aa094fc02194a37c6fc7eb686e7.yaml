desc: Migrate invalid ``it:sec:cpe`` nodes if possible. Expanding on the
  migration helpers added in v2.170.0, this migration will attempt to fix and
  migrate invalid ``it:sec:cpe`` nodes.

  Migration of these nodes will only be successful if one of the CPE2.3 (primary
  property) or the CPE2.2 (``:v2_2``) strings are valid CPEs.  If both CPE
  strings are invalid, the node will be removed from the cortex and stored in a
  queue (``model_0_2_28:nodes``). All references to these invalid nodes will
  also be removed and stored in a separate queue (``model_0_2_28:nodes:refs``).
  Finally, all edges to these invalid nodes will be removed and stored in a
  queue (``model_0_2_28:nodes:edges``).

  The structure of items in these queues are opaque. The intent is for Power-Ups
  to be able to process these queues in an attempt to fix the invalid nodes on a
  per Power-Up basis (the idea being that Power-Up data vendors probably make
  the same mistake consistently).

  During migration or removal of invalid ``it:sec:cpe`` nodes, referencing nodes
  with readonly properties will be removed and stored in the
  ``model_0_2_28:nodes:refs`` queue. We are unable to automatically migrate
  these nodes due to the dynamic nature of their construction.
