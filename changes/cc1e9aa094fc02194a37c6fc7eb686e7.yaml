desc: WARNING: It is strongly advised to perform a backup before upgrading to or
  above this version. The ``it:sec:cpe`` migration described below WILL remove
  invalid ``it:sec:cpe`` and some associated nodes from the Cortex.

  Migrate invalid ``it:sec:cpe`` nodes if possible. Migration of these nodes
  will only be successful if one of the CPE 2.3 (primary property) or the CPE
  2.2 (``:v2_2``) strings are valid CPEs.  If both CPE strings are invalid, the
  node will be removed from the cortex and stored in a queue
  (``model_0_2_31:nodes``).

  The structure of items in this queue is opaque. The intent is for Power-Ups to
  be able to process the queue in an attempt to fix the invalid nodes on a per
  Power-Up basis (the idea being that Power-Up data vendors probably make the
  same mistake consistently).

  During migration or removal of invalid ``it:sec:cpe`` nodes, referencing nodes
  with readonly properties will be removed and also stored in the queue. We are
  unable to automatically migrate these nodes due to the dynamic nature of their
  construction.
