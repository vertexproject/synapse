desc: Add a new Cell configuration option, ``limit:fd:free``. This represents the
  minimum percentage of available file descriptors that a Synapse service that
  is required in order to start up without entering a read-only state. This value
  is also monitored every minute and will disable the Cell Nexus if the free 
  file descriptors drops below the specified value. This value defaults to five
  percent ( ``5 %`` ) of available file descriptors.
