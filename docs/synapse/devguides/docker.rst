Synapse Docker Builds
=====================

This doc details the docker builds and scripts used by Synapse.

Images
------

There are several images provided by the Synapse repository. These are built from an external image that is
periodically updated with core Synapse dependencies.

The images provided include the following:

    vertexproject/synapse
        This container just contains Synapse installed into it. It does not start any services.

    vertexproject/synapse-aha
        This container starts the Aha service.

    vertexproject/synapse-axon
        This container starts the Axon service.

    vertexproject/synapse-cortex
        This container starts the Cortex service.

    vertexproject/synapse-cryotank
        This container starts the Cryotank service.

    vertexproject/synapse-jsonstor
        This container starts the JSONStor service.

    vertexproject/synapse-stemcell
        This container launches the Synapse stemcell server.


Building All Images
-------------------

Images are built using Bash scripts. All of the images can be built directly with a single command:

    ::

        $ ./docker/build_all.sh <optional_image_tag>

If the image tag is not provided, it will tag the images with ``:dev_build``.

Building a Specific Application Image
-------------------------------------

A specific application images can be built as well.

    ::

        $ ./docker/build_image.sh <application> <optional_image_tag>

        # Example of building a local Cortex image.

        $ ./docker/build_image.sh cortex my_test_image

If the image tag is not provided, it will tag the image with ``:dev_build``.

Building the ``vertexproject/synapse`` image
--------------------------------------------

The bare image with only Synapse installed on it can be built like the following:

    ::

        $ docker build --pull -t vertexproject/synapse:$TAG -f docker/images/synapse/Dockerfile .

        # Example of building directly with the tag mytag

        $ docker build --pull -t vertexproject/synapse:mytag -f docker/images/synapse/Dockerfile .

Working with Synapse Images
---------------------------

Developers working with Synapse images should consider the following items:

* The Synapse images are not locked to a specific Python version. The
  underlying Python minor version or base distribution may change. If they do
  change, that will be noted in the Synapse changelog. If you are building
  containers off of a floating tag such as ``vertexproject/synapse:v2.x.x``,
  make sure you are reviewing our :ref:`changelog` for items which may affect
  your use cases. Python patch level updates will not be included in
  the changelogs.

* The ``synapse`` package, and supporting packages, are currently installed
  to the distribution Python environment. The version of ``pip`` installed in
  the containers is PEP668_ aware. If you are installing your own Python
  packages to the distribution Python environment with ```pip``, you will
  need to add the ``--break-system-packages`` argument::

    python -m pip install --break-system-packages yourTargetPackage
