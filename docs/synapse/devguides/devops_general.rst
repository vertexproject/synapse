Backups
-------

It is strongly recommended that users schedule regular backups of all services deployed within their **Synapse**
ecosystem. Each service can be backed up using the **Synapse** backup tool: ``synapse.tools.backup``.

The **Synapse** service architecture is designed to contain everything a service needs within the directory you
specify during service startup.  Take, for example, a **Cortex** started with::

    python -m synapse.servers.cortex /data/cortex00

The **Cortex** will be completely contained within the service working directory ``/data/cortex00``. The synapse tool
``synapse.tools.backup`` may be used to create a backup copy of this working directory which may then be restored.

It is important that you use ``synapse.tools.backup`` rather than simply copying the directory. It is important to avoid
standard file copy operations on running LMDB files due to potentially causing sparse file expansion or producing a
corrupt copy. LMDB makes use of sparse files which allocate file block storage only when the blocks are written to.
This means a file copy tool which is not sparse-file aware can inadvertently cause massive file expansion during copy.

It is also worth noting that the newly created backup is a defragmented / optimized copy of all database data
structures.  As such, we recommend occasionally scheduling a maintenance window to create a "cold backup" with the
service offline and deploy the backup copy when bringing the service back online.  Regularly performing this
"restore from cold backup" procedure can dramatically improve performance and resource utilization.

Running A Backup
****************

Continuing our previous example, running a backup is as simple as::

    python -m synapse.tools.backup /data/cortex00 /backups/cortex00_`date +%Y%m%d`

Assuming that your backup was run on ``May 19, 2020``, this would create a backup in the directory
``/backups/cortex00_20200519``.

The backup command can be run on a live service. Depending on your configuration, creating a live backup
of your service can temporarily degrade performance of the running service. As such, it may be best to schedule
backups during low utilization time windows.

Restoring From Backup
*********************

In the event that restoring from backup is necessary, simply move the service working directory and
copy a previous backup directory to the service working directory location.  From our previous example,
this would involve running the following shell commands::

    mv /data/cortex00 /data/cortex00_old
    cp -R /backups/cortex00_20200519 /data/cortex00
    python -m synapse.servers.cortex /path/to/cortex

TLS/SSL Deployments
-------------------

For production deployments, it is recommended that all services use the built-in ``telepath`` SSL/TLS
protocol. You may deploy a service using TLS encryption by specifying a ``--telepath`` listen URL option, such
as ``ssl://cortex.vertex.link/``.

Under some circumstances, such as inbound DNAT networks or multi-homed hosts, it may be necessary to specify a
socket bind address that is different than the hostname. If your environment requires you to bind an address that
is different than the hostname's DNS entry, an explicit hostname query parameter may be
specified:``ssl://0.0.0.0/?hostname=cortex.vertex.link``.

The client will also need to specify an SSL/TLS ``telepath`` URL such as: ``ssl://visi:passwd@cortex.vertex.link``.

Once the ``ssl`` protocol is specified, the ``hostname``, either from a query parameter or from the URL's
network location, is used to lookup a matching ``crt`` and ``key`` file pair from your server certificate directory
located at ``~/.syn/certs/hosts``. See the following sections for how to setup server certificates.

Self-Signed Certificates using certtool
***************************************

For self-signed certificates, we need to generate a CA certificate and key as well as a server certificate and key.

The synapse ``certtool`` can be used to easily generate a CA and server certificates. For example, if we wanted
to generate a CA certificate for "vertex"::

    python -m synapse.tools.easycert --ca vertex
    key saved: /home/visi/.syn/certs/cas/vertex.key
    cert saved: /home/visi/.syn/certs/cas/vertex.crt

We can then generate a server certificate and keyfile pair and sign it with our new CA::

    python -m synapse.tools.easycert --server cortex.vertex.link --signas vertex
    key saved: /home/visi/.syn/certs/hosts/cortex.vertex.link.key
    cert saved: /home/visi/.syn/certs/hosts/cortex.vertex.link.crt

To verify the server certificate, clients will need to have the ``~/.syn/certs/cas/vertex.crt`` file in their
certificate directory.

NOTE: do not distribute the ``~/.syn/certs/cas/vertex.key`` file as that would allow regular users the ability
to sign arbitrary certificates).

CA-Signed Certificates
**********************

Any external CA may be used to sign ``telepath`` server certificates. The ``certtool`` can be used to easily
generate a certificate signing request (CSR) to be signed by an external CA or you can simply copy or link
pre-existing PEM encoded certificate files to the expected filesystem locations.

To generate a CSR using ``certtool``::
    python -m synapse.tools.easycert --csr --server cortex.vertex.link
    key saved: /home/visi/.syn/certs/hosts/cortex.vertex.link.key
    csr saved: /home/visi/.syn/certs/hosts/cortex.vertex.link.csr

You may then submit your CSR file (in this case ``~/.syn/certs/hosts/cortex.vertex.link.csr``) to your CA of choice for signing.
Once your CA returns a signed certificate in PEM format, place it in the expected location (``~/.syn/certs/hosts/cortex.vertex.link.crt`` in this example)
and it will be loaded when you start your service.
