Axon Operations
===============

The Axon is an interface for providing binary / blob storage inside of the Synapse ecosystem. This indexes binaries
based on SHA-256 hash so we do not duplicate the storage of the same set of bytes twice.

Configuration Options
---------------------

For a list of boot time configuration options for the Axon, see the listing at :ref:`autodoc-axon-conf`.
