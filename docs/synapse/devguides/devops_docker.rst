Synapse Docker Images
=====================

We publish several docker images for Synapse that can be directly used for testing and deployment. By default,
the images use Python 3.8.


.. note::
    Vertex does **not** publish a ``latest`` tag for any of our Docker repositories. Vertex uses Docker tags based on
    git branch names, git release tags, and dynamic Docker tags that track the latest tagged release.


Application-Specific Images
---------------------------
The application-specific images contain entry point scripts which launch their respective Synapse application Cells
from the ``/vertex/storage`` directory. The details for these images can be found on Dockerhub:

- `Aha <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vertexproject/synapse-aha>`_
- `Axon <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vertexproject/synapse-axon>`_
- `Cortex <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vertexproject/synapse-cortex>`_
- `Cryotank <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vertexproject/synapse-cryotank>`_

The following images are available::

    # Tags based on Git branches. The Master tag is always available.
    vertexproject/synapse-aha:master
    vertexproject/synapse-axon:master
    vertexproject/synapse-cortex:master
    vertexproject/synapse-cryotank:master

    # Two tag images are shown as an example.
    # Each git tag has an associated Docker image made for it.
    vertexproject/synapse-aha:v2.28.1
    vertexproject/synapse-axon:v2.28.1
    vertexproject/synapse-cortex:v2.28.1
    vertexproject/synapse-cryotank:v2.28.1

    # There are major version tags which always track the latest release.
    vertexproject/synapse-aha:v2.x.x
    vertexproject/synapse-axon:v2.x.x
    vertexproject/synapse-cortex:v2.x.x
    vertexproject/synapse-cryotank:v2.x.x


Synapse Image
-------------

The generic Synapse image does not have any Synapse-specific application entrypoint defined; executing it will drop a
user into the Python interpreter. The ``-py37`` tags use Python 3.7. It can be found on Dockerhub at
`Synapse <https://hub.docker.com/r/vertexproject/synapse>`_.

The following images are available::

    # Tags based on Git branches. The Master tag is always available.
    vertexproject/synapse:master
    vertexproject/synapse:master-py37

    # Two tag images are shown as an example.
    # Each git tag has an associated Docker image made for it.
    vertexproject/synapse:v2.28.1
    vertexproject/synapse:v2.28.1-py37

    # There are major version tags which always track the latest release.
    vertexproject/synapse:v2.x.x
    vertexproject/synapse:v2.x.x-py37


Base Image
----------

The aforementioned images are built off a base image which contains Synapse's dependencies but not Synapse. This is
available in Python 3.7 and Python 3.8 versions. It can be found on Dockerhub at
`Synapse Base Image 3 <https://hub.docker.com/r/vertexproject/synapse-base-image3>`_.

The following images are available::

    vertexproject/vtx-base-image:py38
    vertexproject/vtx-base-image:py37
