Synapse Admin Guide
###################

This guide is designed for use by Synapse Administrators ("global admins"). Synapse Admins are typically
Synapse power-users with ``admin=true`` privileges on the :ref:`gloss-cortex` who are responsible for
configuration and management of a production instance of Synapse.

The Synapse Admin Guide provides important instructions and background information on topics related to
day-to-day Synapse administrative tasks, and focuses on using :ref:`gloss-storm` to carry out those tasks.

Synapse provides a number of additional methods that can be used to perform some or all of the tasks
described in this guide; however, these methods are **not** covered here. Additional methods include:

- :ref:`stormtypes-libs-header` that allow you to work with a broad range of objects in Synapse.
- Synapse tools that can be used from the host CLI (as opposed to the Storm CLI). Tools are available in
  the `synapse.tools`_ package of the :ref:`apidocs`. The :ref:`userguide` includes documentation on
  some of these :ref:`userguide_tools`.
- The :ref:`http-api`.

.. TIP::

  If you are a commercial Synapse user with the Synapse UI (Optic), see the `UI documentation`_ for
  information on performing Synapse Admin tasks using Optic. Optic simplifies many of Synapse's
  administrative tasks. However, we encourage you to review the information in this guide for
  important background and an overview of the relevant topics.

.. _admin_enable_powerup:

Enable Synapse Power-Ups
========================

The Vertex Project provides a number of Power-Ups that extend the functionality of Synapse. For more
information on configuring your Cortex to use **Rapid Power-Ups,** see `the blog post on Synapse Power-Ups`_.

.. NOTE::
  
  **Advanced Power-Ups** are deployed via their own `Docker containers`_ and are typically configured by
  a DevOps team.


.. _admin_create_users_roles:

Create and Manage Users and Roles
=================================

A :ref:`gloss-user` account is required to authenticate to and access Synapse. Having "a Synapse account"
effectively means having an account in the Cortex.

In Synapse, a :ref:`gloss-role` can be used to "group" users with similar responsibilities (and related
permissions requirements). You can **grant** or **revoke** one or more roles from a user.

You grant (or deny) **permissions** to users or roles by assigning **rules** that specify those permissions
(see :ref:`admin_perms`).

Synapse includes the following built-in users and roles:

- **Root** user. The **root** account has :ref:`admin_bkd_admin` privileges in the Cortex. The **admin**
  status of the root account cannot be revoked, and the account cannot be locked / disabled.
- **All** role. The **all** role has **read** access to the Cortex (specifically, to any view with
  ``worldreadable=true``, which includes the **default** view). All user accounts are automatically granted
  the **all** role (are part of the **all** "group"); this role cannot be revoked.

.. TIP::
  
  The set of Storm :ref:`storm-auth` commands are collectively used to manage users, roles, and permissions
  from Storm.
  
  In the commercial Optic UI, users, roles, and permissions can be managed through the **Admin Tool** and
  through dialogs associated with various objects (such as Views or Stories), in addition to the Storm
  commands.


.. NOTE::
  
  The descriptions and examples below assume that you have deployed Synapse using native Synapse management
  and authentication of users, roles, and permissions.
  
  The :ref:`devopsguide` includes information on provisioning **initial** users when Synapse is first deployed
  (see :ref:`devops-task-users`). This guide focuses on ongoing management of users and roles once Synapse
  admins have access to Storm (the Storm CLI or Optic UI).


.. _admin_users:

Working with Users
------------------

.. _admin_user_add:

Add a User
~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-user-add` command creates a new user. Newly created users do not have any permissions
(other than those associated with the built-in **all** role). 

**Example:**

Add the user "Ron" with email address ``ronthecat@vertex.link``:

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.add ron --email ronthecat@vertex.link

.. TIP::
  
  Users are represented by a unique 128-bit identifier (iden). You can modify information about the user
  account (such as the username or associated email address) without affecting the underlying identifier
  or any associated roles or permissions.

.. _admin_user_show:

Display a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-user-show` command displays information about a user, including any assigned roles or
rules (permissions) and their order.

**Example:**

Display information for user "Ron":

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.show ron


.. _admin_user_mod:

Modify a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-user-mod` command modifies a user account. Use the command to:

- Change the username or email address associated with the user.
- Set or reset the user's password.
- Assign (or remove) **admin** status for the user.
- Lock (or unlock) the account.

**Examples:**

Update the email address for user "Ron":

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.mod ron --email ron@vertex.link

Assign **admin** status to the user "ron_admin":

.. storm-pre:: auth.user.add ron_admin
.. storm-cli:: auth.user.mod ron_admin --admin $lib.true

Remove **admin** status from user "ron_admin":

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.mod ron_admin --admin $lib.false

Lock the user account "ron_admin":

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.mod ron_admin --locked $lib.true

.. WARNING::
  
  We strongly encourage you to **lock** (disable) accounts when necessary instead of deleting them. Changes
  to data in the Cortex (such as creating nodes, setting properties, or adding tags) are associated with the
  user account that made those changes. Deleting an account associated with past changes will prohibit you
  from identifying the user who made those changes.
  
  If necesssary, user accounts can be deleted using the :ref:`stormlibs-lib-auth-users-del` library, but there
  is no equivalent Storm command.


.. _admin_user_list:

List All Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-user-list` command lists all users in the Cortex.

**Example:**

List all users:

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.list
  

.. _admin_roles:

Working with Roles
------------------

.. _admin_role_add:

Add a Role
~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-role-add` command creates a new role. Newly created roles do not have any permissions
or associated user accounts.

**Example:**

Add the new role "cattribution analyst":

.. storm-cli:: auth.role.add "cattribution analyst"

.. TIP::
  
  Roles are represented by a unique 128-bit identifier (iden). You can later change information about the role
  (such as the role name) without affecting the underlying role or any associated permissions or users.


.. _admin_role_show:

Display a Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-role-show` command displays information about a role, including any assigned rules
(permissions) and their associated objects.

**Example:**

Display information for the "all" role:

.. storm-cli:: auth.role.show all


.. _admin_role_mod:

Modify a Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-role-mod` command modifies a role. The command can be used to change the name of the
role.

**Example:**

Change the name of the role "cattribution analyst" to "meow-ware analyst":

.. storm-cli:: auth.role.mod "cattribution analyst" --name "meow-ware analyst"


.. _admin_role_list:

List all Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-role-list` command lists all roles in the Cortex.

**Example:**

List all roles:

.. storm-pre:: auth.role.add "a-cat-emic researcher"
.. storm-pre:: auth.role.add "cattribution analyst"
.. storm-cli:: auth.role.list


.. _admin_role_del:

Delete a Role
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`storm-auth-role-del` command deletes a role.

**Example:**

Delete the role "meow-ware analyst":

.. storm-cli:: auth.role.del "meow-ware analyst"

.. NOTE::
  
  Deleting a role has no impact on any users who have been granted the role (other than losing any permissions
  provided by that role). The user accounts remain intact and the role is simply removed from each user's list
  of roles.


.. _admin_grant_roles:

Grant or Revoke Roles
---------------------

**Granting** a role to a user allows the user to inherit the role's permissions. **Revoking** a role removes the
associated permissions from the user. It is not possible to grant a role to another role (i.e., roles cannot be
nested).

Roles can be granted or revoked using the :ref:`storm-auth-user-grant` and :ref:`storm-auth-user-revoke` commands.

**Examples:**

Grant the role "cattribution analyst" to the user "ron":

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.grant ron "cattribution analyst"

Revoke the role "a-cat-emic researcher" from user "ron":

.. storm-pre:: auth.user.grant ron "a-cat-emic researcher"
.. storm-cli:: auth.user.revoke ron "a-cat-emic researcher"


.. NOTE::
  
  The order in which roles are granted to a user matters; when determining whether a user has permission to
  perform an action, the permissions for each of the user's roles are checked in sequence.
  
  Each role granted to a user is added to the **end** of the set of roles. To "reorder" roles, you must either:
  
  - revoke the roles and grant them in the desired order;
  - use :ref:`stormprims-storm-auth-user-setRoles` to replace the user's roles with a new list of roles.
  - use the commercial Synapse UI (Optic) to reorder the roles using drag-and drop.
  
  See :ref:`admin_perms_background` for additional detail on permissions and :ref:`admin_bkd_precedence`.


.. _admin_perms:

Assign and Manage Permissions
=============================

Synapse provides a highly flexible system of role-based access control (RBAC). **Rules** are used to assign
permissions to users and / or roles, with a defined order of precedence for how permissions are evaluated.

Permissions can be assigned very broadly, such as allowing a user (or role) to create / modify / delete any node.
Permissions can also be very fine-grained, restricting users so that they can **only** create specific nodes, set
specific properties, create specific edges, or apply specific tags.

Before describing how to set and manage permissions, it is helpful to provide some terminology and an overview
of how permissions are used within Synapse.


..  _admin_perms_background:

Permissions Background
----------------------

Before describing how to assign and manage permissions in Synapse, it is helpful to define some key components
of Synapse and the permissions ecosystem.


.. _admin_bkd_services:

Services
~~~~~~~~

Synapse is designed as a modular set of **services.** A service can be thought of as a container used to run an
application. **Synapse services** make up the core Synapse architecture, and include the :ref:`gloss-cortex`
(data store), :ref:`gloss-axon` (file storage), and the commercial :ref:`gloss-optic` UI. Services handle user
authentication and authorization.

From a Synapse Admin perspective, you will primarily be concerned with managing user accounts and permissions to
(and within) the Synapse **Cortex.**

.. TIP::
  
  When we talk about "Synapse users" or "permissions to Synapse" we are generally referring to user accounts and
  roles in a Cortex, and permissions to a Cortex and its associated objects.
  
  Depending on your Synapse deployment, you may need to grant or manage permissions to additional Synapse services.
  See the sections on :ref:`admin_axon_perms`, :ref:`admin_optic_perms`, and :ref:`admin_power_perms` for details.

.. _admin_bkd_cortex:

Cortex
~~~~~~

The **Cortex** is Synapse's primary data store. Users and roles are created and managed in the Cortex, and most
things for which users will need permissions apply to the Cortex and to the views, layers, and data (nodes, tags,
etc.) that reside there.

.. _admin_bkd_authgate:

Auth Gate
~~~~~~~~~

An **Auth Gate** (or "gate", informally) is an object within a service (such as a Cortex) that may have its own
set of permissions. A :ref:`gloss-view` and a :ref:`gloss-layer` are both common examples of Auth Gates.

Auth Gates are represented by a 128-bit identifier (iden) that uniquely identifies the Auth Gate object itself.
They also have an associated type to specify the kind of Auth Gate object (e.g., "view"). Some Auth Gates also
support the use of "user friendly" names, though this is dependent on the type of Auth Gate and has no impact on
the underlying iden or associated permissions.

.. _admin_bkd_scope:

Scope
~~~~~

**Scope** refers to the object to which a particular permission applies. For example, permissions granted on an
Auth Gate (such as a view) are scoped to (or **local** to) that Auth Gate. Permissions granted at the Cortex level
are **global** with respect to the Cortex.

Scope affects the order (precedence) in which permissions are evaluated.

.. _admin_bkd_permission:

Permission
~~~~~~~~~~

A **permission** is a string that is used to control access. For example:

``view.add``

Most permission strings use a dotted (hierarchical) format; specifying a permission higher up in the hierarchy
includes all permissions below it. For example, the permission ``view`` includes all of the following permissions:
``view.add``, ``view.del``, ``view.read``, and ``view.set``.

Permissions related to objects such as nodes or tags can optionally extend the permission string to be highly
specific, referencing particular forms, properties, tags/tag trees, or light edges. This allows you to set highly
granular permissions.

For example:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| **Description**                                                 | **Permission**                  |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+

.. TIP::
  
  Granular permissions may be useful for organizations with specialized users or teams, where certain
  individuals are responsible for specific types of analysis (e.g., strategic analysis vs. tactical
  threat tracking) and should be the only users authorized to create, link, and tag certain types of data.
  
  Granular permissions can also be used to differentiate between senior and junior roles; for example,
  only senior analysts may be allowed to apply tags representing certain assessments (such as attribution).

.. _admin_bkd_rule:

Rule
~~~~

A **rule** is used to grant (or prohibit) a specific permission. Rules are evaluated in a defined order
of precedence.

When you specify a rule, there is an implicit **allow** directive; a permission string by itself
indicates the permission is allowed/true:

``view.add``

To use a rule to **deny** a permission, use the "not" or "bang" symbol ( ``!`` ) to indicate the permission
is denied/false:

``!node.tag.add.mytag``


.. _admin_bkd_precedence:

Precedence
~~~~~~~~~~

**Rules** in Synapse are evaluated in order of **precedence.** A requested action will be allowed (or
denied) based on the **first matching rule** found for the action. If no matching rule is found, the
action is **denied.**

Generally speaking, rules are evaluated from "most specific" to "least specific". Rules are evaluated
in the following order:

- **User** rules at the **local** (i.e., Auth Gate) level.
- **Role** rules at the **local** level.
- **User** rules at the **global** (i.e., Cortex) level.
- **Role** rules at the **global** level.

**Roles** (granted to a user) and **rules** (assigned to a user or role) are **also ordered:**

- When granting roles to a user, each new role is added to the **end** of the list of roles.
- When assigning rules to a role or user, each new rule is added to the **end** of the list of rules.

Rules and roles are evaluated in the following order:

- **User rules** are evaluated in order from first to last.
- Each **role** granted to a user is evaluated in order from first to last.
- For each role, the **role's rules** are evaluated in order from first to last.

This means that the same rules, applied and evaluated in a different order, will give different results.
As a simple example:

These rules will **allow** the creation of ``file:bytes`` nodes, but no other nodes:

::

  node.add.file:bytes
  !node.add

The same rules in the opposite order will **disallow** the creation of **any** nodes:

::
  
  !node.add
  node.add.file:bytes


.. _admin_bkd_admin:

Admin
~~~~~

Admin status allows a user to **bypass all permissions checks** for the **scope** where the user is admin.
For example, a Synapse (Cortex) admin user can bypass all Cortex permissions checks (can "do anything"
within the Cortex).

Users are generally **admin** of objects that they create. A user who forks a view is **admin** for the view
that they fork, and can bypass all permissions checks ("do anything") within the forked view.

.. NOTE::
  
  It is not possible to assign **admin** privileges to a role.


.. _admin_bkd_easyperms:

Easy Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Easy permissions ("easy perms" for short) is a mechanism that simplifies granting common sets of permissions
to users or roles for a particular object. Where easy perms are used, you can specify four levels of access:
**deny, read, edit,** and **admin.** These access levels have corresponding integer values:

- Deny = 0
- Read = 1
- Edit = 2
- Admin = 3

Easy perms apply to specific objects. Where easy perms are available, the following conventions apply:

- The user who creates the object has **admin** privileges for that object.
- **Admin** privileges include the ability to grant permissions to others (including explicitly denying
  access).
- Admin privileges are required to **delete** the object (i.e., **edit** permissions do not include **delete**).

.. TIP::
  
  `$lib.macro.grant`_ library is an example of where easy permissions can be used to assign permissions.

.. _admin_bkd_views_layers:

Views and Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data in a Cortex is stored in one or more **layers** (see :ref:`gloss-layer`). The data that a user or
a role can see is defined by a :ref:`gloss-view` that is composed of one or more ordered layers. (A
standard installation of Synapse consists of the default view, which contains one layer.)

The ability to see (read) data in a view is "all or nothing" - you cannot allow users to see some nodes in
a view but not others. If you need to segregate data (based on sensitivity or other criteria), you can use
multiple layers to do this. The layers can be composed into different views, allowing different users to see
(read) only the data in the view(s) they should have access to.

Views act as a **read** boundary for the data a user or role can **see.** Granting the ``view.read`` permission
on a view allows users to see (read) data in any of the view's layers; you do not need to explicitly grant
"read" access to the individual layers themselves.

Layers act as a **write** boundary for the data a user or role can **modify** (create / edit / delete). In
normal circumstances, only the top layer in a view is writable. The ability to write data **to** a layer is
controlled by the various ``node.*`` permissions, which specify the forms / properties / tags / light edges a
user or role can work with (create / modify / delete). Permissions to modify data must be assigned at the
appropriate **layer.**


.. _admin_assign_perms:

Assign Permissions
------------------

You assign (allow or deny) permissions in Synapse by adding rules to (or removing rules from) roles or users.
Recall that **order matters** when adding rules (see :ref:`admin_bkd_precedence`).

From a Synapse Admin perspective, managing permissions within Synapse commonly involves:

- Assigning rules to users and roles within the Cortex.
- Assigning rules to users and roles for various Auth Gates (such as layers or views) if necessary.
- Assigning rules to users and roles to allow or deny access to additional services, such as an Axon or
  various Power-Ups.

Permissions in Synapse are managed using the Storm :ref:`storm-auth` commands.

In the commercial Optic UI, permissions can also be managed through the **Admin Tool** and through dialogs
associated with various objects (such as Views or Stories), in addition to the Storm commands.

.. TIP::
  
  If a user attempts an action that they do not have permissions to perform, Synapse will return an ``AuthDeny``
  error that lists the specific permission that is required.

.. NOTE::
  
  The descriptions and examples below assume that you have deployed Synapse using native Synapse management
  and authentication of users, roles, and permissions.


.. admin_default_perms:

Default Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synapse includes the following default permissions:

- The built-in **root** user has **admin** access (``admin=true``) to the Cortex.
- The built-in **all** role has **read** access (``view.read``) to any view created with ``worldreadable=True``.
  This includes the **default** view.

Any additional permissions must be **explicitly granted** to users or roles. In all but a few edge cases,
Synapse assumes an implicit default ``deny all`` as the final rule evaluated when checking permissions.

.. NOTE::
  
  There are a few edge cases where a specific permission assumes a **default allow** instead of a **default deny,**
  but these are uncommon. These cases are highly specific, and usually arise in cases where a **new** permission
  has been implemented. That is, an action that was not originally subject to a permissions check now has one
  (usually because of a need to explicitly **deny** that action to particular users or roles).
  
  If a previously unchecked action were added with "default deny", it would potentially break existing Synapse
  deployments by suddenly blocking an action that had been previously allowed (ungated). In these circumstances
  the new permission is given a "default allow" that can then be specifically denied if necessary.


.. admin_global_perms:

Global (Cortex) Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permissions in Synapse can be assigned at the global (Cortex) level, or to a specific Auth Gate (see
:ref:`admin_authgate_perms`). To assign permissions to an Auth Gate, you must specify its identifier (iden)
(i.e., using the ``--gate`` option to the appropriate Storm command) when adding the associated rule to a user
or role.

If you do not specify an Auth Gate, the permissions are **global** and apply to any / all instances within the
Cortex where a user or role has access. For example, the following Storm command:

::
  
  auth.role.addrule all node

...grants (allows) the ``node`` permission to the built-in **all** role. This allows **any** user (because all
users are granted the **all** role by default) to perform **any** action on **any** node in **any** layer that
is the topmost (writeable) layer in **any** view that the user can see.

Specifying rules at the global (Cortex) level may be sufficient for many basic Synapse deployments.

.. NOTE::
  
  Recall that **order matters** when adding rules; each rule is added to the end of the list of rules assigned
  to a user or role, and rules are evaluated in order of precedence. To reorder rules, you must:
  
  - remove and re-add them in the new order;
  - use :ref:`stormprims-storm-auth-user-setRules` or :ref:`stormprims-storm-auth-role-setRules` to replace the
    rules for a user or role with a new set of rules;
  - use the commercial Synapse UI (Optic) to reorder rules using drag-and-drop.

Assign Permissions
******************

Permissions rules (allow or deny) are assigned using the :ref:`storm-auth-user-addrule` and :ref:`storm-auth-role-addrule`
commands.

**Examples:**

Prevent the user "ron" from setting tag descriptions (setting the ``syn:tag:desc`` property):

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.addrule ron "!node.prop.set.syn:tag:desc"

.. TIP::
  
  Deny rules specified with Storm must be enclosed in quotes (single or double) because they begin with
  a symbol ( ``!`` ).


Allow the role "senior analysts" to add tags in threat attribution (``cno.threat``) tag tree:

.. storm-pre:: auth.role.add "senior analysts"
.. storm-cli:: auth.role.addrule "senior analysts" node.tag.add.cno.threat

Prevent the "all" role from deleting nodes:

.. storm-cli:: auth.role.addrule all "!node.del"

.. TIP::
  
  Recall that you can :ref:`admin-user-show` or :ref:`admin-role-show` with the :ref:`storm-auth-user-show`
  and :ref:`storm-auth-role-show` commands.


Revoke Permissions
******************

Permissions rules are revoked using the ``auth.user.delrule`` and ``auth.role.delrule`` commands.

**Examples:**

Revoke the rule that prevents user "ron" from setting tag descriptions:

.. storm-cli:: auth.user.delrule ron "!node.prop.set.syn:tag:desc"


Revoke the rule that allows "junior analysts" to apply tags in the ``cno.threat`` tag tree:

.. storm-pre:: auth.role.add "junior analysts"
.. storm-pre:: auth.role.addrule "junior analysts" node.tag.cno.threat

.. storm-cli:: auth.role.delrule "junior analysts" node.tag.cno.threat


.. _admin_authgate_perms:

Auth Gate Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To assign permissions for an Auth Gate, you use the same Storm commands used to assign global permissions, but
you must specify the Auth Gate's full identifier (iden) (using the ``--gate`` option) when adding or
removing the rule.

Obtain a Gate's Iden
********************

The Storm :ref:`storm-view` and :ref:`storm-layer` commands can be used to manage views and layers, respectively.
In particular, the following commands are useful for displaying all views or layers (including their idens), or
displaying a specific view or layer:

- :ref:`storm-view-list`
- :ref:`storm-view-get`
- :ref:`storm-layer-list`
- :ref:`storm-layer-get`

**Example:**

Display all views:

.. storm-cli:: view.list

View a Gate's Permissions
*************************

The ``auth.gate.show`` command is used to display permissions information about a particular Auth Gate (e.g.,
a view or layer). You can provide the specific iden for an Auth Gate, or use the syntax below to retrieve
information for the **current** view or layer. (Viewing information for the "current layer" will return
information for the top layer of the current view.)

**Example:**

Display information for the current view:

.. storm-cli:: auth.gate.show $lib.view.get().iden

Display information for the current layer:

.. storm-cli:: auth.gate.show $lib.layer.get().iden


.. _admin_axon_perms:

Axon Permissions
----------------

You must specifically grant users or roles permission to access (upload, check, or retrieve) files within a
storage Axon.

- See the :ref:`deploy_axon` section of the :ref:`deploymentguide` for information on Axon deployment.
- See the :ref:`devops-svc-axon` section of the :ref:`devopsguide` for information on Axon configuration,
  including a description of Axon permissions.


.. _admin_optic_perms:

Optic Permissions
-----------------

Commercial Synapse customers with the Optic UI may need to explicitly grant users or roles permission to some
UI tools (such as Spotlight).

- See the `Optic Deployment Guide`_ for information on Optic deployment.
- See the `Optic DevOps Guide`_ for information on Optic permissions and other features.

.. TIP::
  
  You do not need to explicitly grant permissions to Optic itself. If you are creating and managing Synapse
  ("Cortex") users and roles via Optic, they have permission to access Optic by default.


.. _admin_power_perms:

Power-Up Permissions
--------------------

Synapse **Power-Ups** have their own sets of permissions that must be granted to users or roles to allow them
to use the Power-Up and any associated Storm commands. Specific permissions are documented in the **Admin Guide**
section of the `Power-Up documentation`_ for the individual Power-Up.

.. TIP::
  
  While most Vertex-provided Power-Ups are part of the commercial Synapse offering, the following `Rapid Power-Ups`_
  are also available for use with the community (open source) version of Synapse:
  
  - `Synapse-MISP`_
  - `Synapse-MITRE-ATT&CK`_
  - `Synapse-PSL`- (FQDN public suffix list)
  - `Synapse-TOR`_

.. _admin_runtime_perms:

Storm Runtime Permissions
-------------------------

When a user runs a Storm query **interactively** (e.g., in the Storm CLI or via the Optic Query Bar), or
performs an action in the Optic UI (such as accessing a menu option), the query or action executes
**with the permissions of the user,** based on the applicable user and role permissions and the current scope
for the query or action.

There are a few cases of Storm runtime execution where different permissions are used that may require
additional considerations.

Automation
~~~~~~~~~~

Synapse includes the ability to automate Storm-based tasks using triggers, cron jobs, and / or macros. These
elements are all impacted by permissions in various ways, including:

- who can create or manage automation (e.g., by default any user can create a macro, but explicit permissions
  are required to create triggers or cron jobs);
- who a given piece of automation runs as (e.g., macros run as the user who executes them, but triggers and
  cron jobs run as the user who created them).

Refer to the :ref:`storm-ref-automation` section of the :ref:`userguide` for a detailed discussion of
automation in Synapse (including permissions considerations).


Power-Ups
~~~~~~~~~

Power-Ups implement Storm packages and Storm services to provide additional functionality to Synapse.
Power-Ups may be provided by The Vertex Project (as free or commercial offerings). Organizations may also
develop their own custom Power-Ups.

Power-Ups commonly install Storm commands to allow users to make use of the additional capabilities of the
Power-Up. In some cases, Power-Ups may need to access sensitive data (such as API keys or similar credentials)
or perform actions (e.g., in adding nodes or applying tags) that some users would not be allowed to perform
on their own.

Power-Ups can use privilege separation ("privsep") so that a limited subset of Power-Up capabilities can
run with elevated privileges if necessary, with the remainder of the code running as the user who calls
the Power-Up.

See the :ref:`dev_rapid_power_ups` section of the :ref:`devguide` for additional details.

.. NOTE::
  
  Synapse Admins are typically only responsible for ensuring that the appropriate users and roles can use
  or run individual Power-Ups (see :ref:`admin_power_perms`). While Synapse Admins should be aware of privilege
  separation within a Power-Up as a best practice, implementation of privilege separation is left to
  Power-Up developers.


.. _admin_extend_model:

Add Extended Model Elements
===========================

The Synapse data model in a Cortex can be extended with custom `forms`_ or `properties`_ by using the model
extension Storm Library (:ref:`stormlibs-lib-model-ext`). Extended model forms and properties must have names
beginning with an underscore (``_``) to avoid potential conflicts with built-in model elements.

Extended Forms
--------------

When adding a form, ``$lib.model.ext.addForm`` takes the following arguments:

``formname``
    Name of the form, must begin with an underscore (``_``) and contain at least one colon (``:``).

``basetype``
    The `Synapse data model type`_ for the form.

``typeopts``
    A dictionary of type specific options.

``typeinfo``
    A dictionary of info values for the form.

To add a new form named ``_foocorp:name``, which contains string values which will be normalized to
lowercase, with whitespace stripped from the beginning/end::

    $typeopts = ({'lower': $lib.true, 'strip': $lib.true})
    $typeinfo = ({'doc': 'Foocorp name.'})

    $lib.model.ext.addForm(_foocorp:name, str, $typeopts, $typeinfo)

If the form is no longer in use and there are no nodes of this form in the Cortex, it can be removed with::

    $lib.model.ext.delForm(_foocorp:name)

Extended Properties
-------------------

When adding properties, ``$lib.model.ext.addFormProp`` takes the following arguments:

``formname``
    Name of the form to add the property to, may be a built-in or extended model form.

``propname``
    Relative name of the property, must begin with an underscore (``_``).

``typedef``
    A tuple of (``type``, ``typeopts``) which defines the type for the property

``propinfo``
    A dictionary of info values for the property.

To add a property named ``_score`` to the ``_foocorp:name`` form which contains int values between 0 and 100::

    $typeopts = ({'min': 0, 'max': 100})
    $propinfo = ({'doc': 'Score for this name.'})

    $lib.model.ext.addFormProp(_foocorp:name, _score, (int, $typeopts), $propinfo)

To add a property named ``_aliases`` to the ``_foocorp:name`` form which contains a unique array of
``ou:name`` values::

    $typeopts = ({'type': 'ou:name', 'uniq': $lib.true})
    $propinfo = ({'doc': 'Aliases for this name.'})

    $lib.model.ext.addFormProp(_foocorp:name, _aliases, (array, $typeopts), $propinfo)

Properties may also be added to existing forms, for example, to add a property named ``_classification`` to
``inet:fqdn`` which must contain a string from a predefined set of values::

    $typeopts = ({'enums': 'unknown,benign,malicious'})
    $propinfo = ({'doc': 'Classification for this FQDN.'})

    $lib.model.ext.addFormProp(inet:fqdn, _classification, (str, $typeopts), $propinfo)

Extended Universal Properties
-----------------------------

Similar to ``$lib.model.ext.addFormProp``, ``$lib.model.ext.addUnivProp`` takes the same ``propname``,
``typedef``, and ``propinfo`` arguments, but applies to all forms.


.. _admin_config_mirror:

Configure a Mirrored Layer
==========================

A Cortex may be configured to mirror a layer from a remote Cortex which will synchronize all edits from the
remote layer and use write-back support to facilitate edits originating from the downstream layer. The mirrored
layer will be an exact copy of the layer on the remote system including all edit history and will only allow
changes which are first sent to the upstream layer.

When configuring a mirrored layer, you may choose to mirror from a remote layer *or* from the top layer of a
remote view. If you choose to mirror from the top layer of a remote view, that view will have the opportunity
to fire triggers and enforce model constraints on the changes being provided by the mirrored layer.

To specify a remote layer as the upstream, use a Telepath URL which includes the shared object
``*/layer/<layeriden>`` such as::

    aha://cortex.loop.vertex.link/*/layer/8ea600d1732f2c4ef593120b3226dea3

To specify a remote view, use the shared object ``*/view/<viewiden>`` such as::

     aha://cortex.loop.vertex.link/*/view/8ea600d1732f2c4ef593120b3226dea3

When you specify a ``--mirror`` option to the ``layer.add`` command or within a layer definition provided to the
``$lib.layer.add()`` Storm API the telepath URL will not be checked. This allows configuration of a remote layer
or view which is not yet provisioned or is currently offline.

.. note::

    To allow write access, the telepath URL must allow admin access to the remote Cortex due to being able to
    fabricate edit origins. The telepath URL may use aliased names or TLS client side certs to prevent credential
    disclosure.

Once a mirrored layer is configured, it will need to stream down the entire history of events from the upstream
layer.  During this process, the layer will be readable but writes will hang due to needing to await the write-back
to be fully caught up to guarantee that edits are immediately observable like a normal layer.  During that process,
you may track progress by calling the ``getMirrorStatus()`` API on the ``storm:layer`` object within the Storm runtime.
