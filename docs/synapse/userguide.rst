Synapse User Guide
##################

This User Guide is written by and for Synapse users and is intended to provide a general overview of
Synapse concepts and operations. Technical documentation appropriate for Synapse deployment and
development can be found elsewhere in the Document Index_.

The User Guide is a living document and will continue to be updated and expanded as appropriate. The
current sections are:

   userguides/index_storm_adv

Many of the concepts above are closely related and this outline represents a reasonable effort to
introduce concepts in a illogical order. However, it is difficult to fully understand the potential of
Synapse without grasping the power of the Storm query language to understand, manipulate, and annotate
data. Similarly, it’s hard to understand the effectiveness of Storm without knowledge of the underlying
data model. The outline above is our suggested order but readers are encouraged to skip around or
revisit earlier sections after digesting later sections to better see how these topics are tied
together.
