    "Synapse Developers Guide\n",
    "########################\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is intended for developers looking to integrate Synapse components with other applications by using the Telepath API.  Additionally, this guide will introduce developers to writing custom Cortex modules in Python to allow custom data model extensions, storm commands, ingest functions, and change hooks.  This guide assumes familiarity with deploying Cortex servers and the Storm query syntax.  For help on getting started, see :ref:`quickstart`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For complete API documentation on all Synapse components see :ref:`apidocs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote Cortex Access\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cortex, like most synapse components, provides two mechanisms for remote API calls.  The HTTP/REST API and the Telepath API.  For additional documentation on the Cortex HTTP API, see :ref:`http-api`.  This guide will cover remote API calls using Telepath.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telepath is an asynchronous, high-performance, streaming oriented, RPC protocol.  It is designed for minimum development effort and maximum performance.  Data is serialized using the highly efficient Message_Pack_ format which is not only more size efficient than JSON, but allows serialization of binary data and supports incremental decoding for use in stream based protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telepath allows a client to connect to a Python object shared on a remote server and, in most instances, call methods as though the object were local.  However, this means all arguments and return values must be serializable using Message Pack.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to a remote object, the caller specifies a URI to connect and construct a Telepath Proxy.  In the following examples, we will assume a Cortex was previously setup and configured with the user ``visi`` and the password ``secretsauce`` running on port ``27492`` on the host ``1.2.3.4``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making a simple call\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a Telepath proxy is connected, most methods may simply be called as though the object were local.  For example, the ``getModelDict`` method on the ``CoreApi`` returns a Python dictionary containing the details of the data model in the remote Cortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "    import asyncio\n",
    "    import synapse.telepath as s_telepath\n",
    "\n",
    "    async def main():\n",
    "\n",
    "        async with await s_telepath.openurl('tcp://visi:secretsauce@1.2.3.4:27492/') as core:\n",
    "\n",
    "            model = await core.getModelDict()\n",
    "\n",
    "            for form in model.get('forms'):\n",
    "                dostuff()\n",
    "\n",
    "    if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "        asyncio.run(main())\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many objects in the Synapse ecosystem, a Telepath proxy inherits from ``synapse.lib.base.Base``.  This requires the ``fini`` method to be called to release resources and close sockets.  In the example above, we use the async context manager implemented by the ``Base`` class (``async with``) to ensure that the proxy is correctly shutdown.  However, Telepath is designed for long-lived Proxy objects to minimize API call delay by using existing sockets and sessions.  A typical app will create a telepath proxy during initialization and only create a new one in the event that the remote Telepath server is restarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example also demonstrates that Telepath is designed for use with Python 3.7 asyncio.  However, the Telepath proxy can also be constructed and used transparently from non-async code as seen below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generators and Yielding\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the Telepath APIs published by Synapse services are capable of yielding results as a generator to facilitate incremental reads and time_to_first_byte_ (TTFB) optimizations.  In the remote case, this means the caller may receive and begin processing results before all of the results have been enumerated by the server.  Any Python async generator method on a shared object may be iterated by a client with full back_pressure_ to the server.  This means a caller may issue a query which returns a very large result set and consume them incrementally without concern over client/server memory exhaustion due to buffering a large result set.  The following example demonstrates using the Cortex ``eval`` API to retrieve nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",

    "Developing Cortex Modules\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Basics\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cortex allows developers to implement and load custom modules by extending the ``synapse.lib.module.CoreModule`` class.  A ``CoreModule`` can be used to customize a Cortex in many ways, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Model Extensions\n",
    "* Custom Storm Commands\n",
    "* Custom Ingest Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with great power comes great danger.  Bugs in a ``CoreModule`` subclass can easily cause a Cortex to crash or become unresponsive.  Cortex module developers must be familiar with the Python asynchronous programming paradigm.  The only exception is for simple data model extensions which only require a single method that returns a data model extension dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guide, we will assume a Python module named ``example`` with a ``CoreModule`` subclass named ``ExampleModule``."

The Vertex Project has reserved the namespace prefix ``x:`` for custom model extensions and will never create mainline Synapse model elements within that namespace.

The main execution of a ``Cmd`` subclass is handled by the ``execStormCmd`` method which iterates over the ``(Node, Path)`` tuples it is given and yields ``(Node, Path)`` tuples as results.
