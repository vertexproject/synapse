Synapse User Interface
======================

Optic (the Synapse UI) is part of `The Vertex Project <https://vertex.link>`_'s commercial offering, Synapse Enterprise. Synapse Enterprise is an on-premises solution that includes `Optic <https://synapse.docs.vertex.link/projects/optic/en/latest/index.html>`_ and all of the Power-Ups. The license includes unlimited users and does not limit the amount of data or number of instances you deploy. We take a white-glove approach to each deployment where we're with you every step of the way from planning deployment sizes to helping to train your analysts.

Feel free to `contact us <https://vertex.link/contact-us>`_ or `request a demo instance <https://vertex.link/request-a-demo>`_.

For additional information see the `Optic Documentation <https://synapse.docs.vertex.link/projects/optic/en/latest/index.html>`_.
