Synapse User Interface
======================


The Synapse UI is a WebUI which integrates with a Cortex to provide a view into your Synapse
Ecosystem. A few important UI features include:

    - Directly supports collaborative analysis. Users can view changes made by their teammates immediately. This enables
      them to rapidly work together as peers.

    - Simplified Storm query bar and point-and-click navigation for exploring data. Users can visualize their data in
      multiple ways:

        - Tabular
        - Forcegraph
        - Statistics
        - Geospatial

    - Share your work! The UI contains the ability to generate reports directly from the Cortex. These can even be
      styled to meet your organizations needs.

    - Control your automation. Cron Jobs, Macros and Triggers are all automation tools which can be managed directly
      in the UI.

    - Directly manage your Rapid Power-Ups and get inline documentation for all the Power-Ups installed in the system.

    - Choose your collaborators. Users and Roles can all be managed by the UI, allowing you to designate additional
      admins, create analysis teams, and control access to system functionality.
