Enable Synapse Power-Ups
########################

The Vertex Project provides a number of Power-Ups that extend the functionality of Synapse. For more
information on configuring your Cortex to use **Rapid Power-Ups,** see `the blog post on Synapse Power-Ups`_.

.. NOTE::
  
  **Advanced Power-Ups** are deployed via their own `Docker containers`_ and are typically configured by
  a DevOps team.
