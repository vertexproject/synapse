Storm Reference - Introduction
==============================

**Storm** is the query language used to interact with data in Synapse. Storm allows you to ask about, retrieve, annotate, add, modify, and delete data within a Synapse Cortex. Most Synapse users will access Synapse via the Storm command-line interface (**Storm CLI**) (see :ref:`syn-tools-storm`):

::
  
  storm> <query>


.. note::

  If you're just getting started with Synapse, you can use the Synapse Quickstart_ to quickly set up and connect to a local Cortex using the Storm CLI.

This section covers several important high-level Storm concepts:

Storm Background
----------------

In designing Storm, we needed it to be flexible and powerful enough to allow interaction with large amounts of data and a wide range of disparate data types. However, we also needed Storm to be intuitive and efficient so it would be accessible to a wide range of users. We wrote Storm specifically to be used by analysts and other users from a variety of knowledge domains who are not necessarily programmers and who would not want to use what felt like a "programming language".

Wherever possible, we masked Storm’s underlying programmatic complexity. The intent is for Storm to act more like a "data language", allowing users to:

- **Reference data and query operations in an intuitive form.** We took a "do what I mean" approach for how users interact with and use Storm so that users can focus on the **data** and the relationships among the data, not the query language. Once you get the gist of it, Storm "just works"! This is because Storm and Synapse make use of a number of features "under the hood" such as property normalization, type enforcement / type awareness, and syntax and query optimization, to make Storm easier for you to use. Synapse and Storm do the work in the background so you can focus on analysis.

- **Use a simple yet powerful syntax to run Storm queries.** Storm uses intuitive keyboard symbols (such as an "arrow" ( ``->`` ) for pivot operations) for efficient querying, as well as a natural language-like syntax. This makes using Storm feel more like "asking a question" than "constructing a data query". In fact, one method we use to teach Storm to new users is to practice "translating" questions into queries (you'll be surprised how straightforward it is!).

Analysts still need to learn the Storm "language" - forms (:ref:`data-form`) and tags (:ref:`data-tag`) are Storm's "words", and Storm operators allows you to construct "sentences". That said, the intent is for Storm to function more like "how do I ask this question about the data?" and not "how do I write a program to get the data I need?"

Finally – and most importantly – **giving analysts direct access to Storm allows them to create arbitrary queries and provides them with an extraordinarily powerful analytical tool.** Analysts are not constrained to a set of "canned" queries provided through a GUI or an API. Instead, they can follow their analysis wherever it takes them, creating queries as needed and working with the data in whatever manner is most appropriate to their research.

.. _storm-ops-basic:

Basic Storm Operations
----------------------

Storm allows users to perform all of the common operations used to interact with data in Synapse:

- **Lift:** – retrieve data based on specified criteria. (:ref:`storm-ref-lift`)
- **Filter:** – refine your results by including or excluding a subset of nodes based on specified criteria. (:ref:`storm-ref-filter`)
- **Pivot:** – take a set of nodes and identify other nodes that share one or more property values with the lifted set. (:ref:`storm-ref-pivot`)
- **Data modification:** – add, modify, annotate, and delete nodes from Synapse. (:ref:`storm-ref-data-mod`)

Additional operations include:

- **Traverse** light edges. (:ref:`light-edge`, :ref:`walk-light-edge`)
- **Pipe** (send) nodes to Storm commands (:ref:`storm-ref-cmd`). Storm supports an extensible set of commands such as :ref:`storm-limit`, :ref:`storm-max`, or :ref:`storm-uniq`. These commands provide specific functionality to further extend the analytical power of Storm. Additional Storm commands allow management of permissions for users and roles, Synapse views and layers, and Synapse's automation features (:ref:`storm-ref-automation`). Available commands can be displayed by running ``help`` from the Storm CLI.

Storm also incorporates a number of :ref:`storm-ops-adv` that provide even greater power and flexibility.

.. note::

  While Storm queries can range from the very simple to the highly complex, all Storm queries are constructed from this relatively small set of "building blocks". Most users, especially when they first start, only need the handful of blocks listed above!


Lift, Filter, and Pivot Criteria
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The main operations carried out with Storm are lifting, filtering, and pivoting (we include traversing light edges as part of "pivoting"). When conducting these operations, you need to be able to clearly specify the data you are interested in – your selection criteria. In most cases, the criteria you specify will be based on one or more of the following:

- A **property** (primary or secondary) on a node.
- A specific **value** for a property (*<form> = <valu>* or *<prop> = <pval>*) on a node.
- A **tag** on a node.
- The existence of a **light edge** linking nodes.
- The name ("verb") of a specific **light edge** linking nodes. 

All of the above elements – nodes, properties, values, and tags – are the fundamental building blocks of the Synapse data model (see :ref:`data-model-terms`). **As such, an understanding of the Synapse data model is essential to effective use of Storm.**

.. _storm-whitespace-literals:

Whitespace and Literals in Storm
--------------------------------

Storm allows (and in some cases requires) whitespace within Storm to separate syntax elements such as commands and command arguments.

Quotation marks are used to **preserve** whitespace characters and other special characters in literals used within Storm.

.. _storm-whitespace:

Using Whitespace Characters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Whitespace characters (i.e., spaces) are used within Storm to separate command line arguments. Specifically, whitespace characters are used to separate commands, command arguments, command operators, variables and literals.

When entering a query/command in Storm, one or more whitespace characters are **required** between the following command line arguments:

- A command (such as ``max``) and command line parameters (in this case, the property ``:asof``):
  
  ``storm> inet:whois:rec:fqdn=vertex.link | max :asof``
  
- An unquoted literal and any subsequent argument or operator:
  
  ``storm> inet:email=support@vertex.link | count``
  
  ``storm> inet:email=support@vertex.link -> *``

Whitespace characters can **optionally** be used when performing the following operations:

- Assigning values using the equals sign assignment operator:
  
  ``storm> [inet:ipv4=192.168.0.1]``
  
  ``storm> [inet:ipv4 = 192.168.0.1]``

- Comparison operations:
  
  ``storm> file:bytes:size>65536``
  
  ``storm> file:bytes:size > 65536``

- Pivot operations:
  
  ``storm> inet:ipv4->*``
  
  ``storm> inet:ipv4 -> *``
  
- Specifying the content of edit brackets or edit parentheses:

  ``storm> [inet:fqdn=vertex.link]``
  
  ``storm> [ inet:fqdn=vertex.link ]``
  
  ``storm> [ inet:fqdn=vertx.link (inet:ipv4=1.2.3.4 :asn=5678) ]``
  
  ``storm> [ inet:fqdn=vertex.link ( inet:ipv4=1.2.3.4 :asn=5678 ) ]``

Whitespace characters **cannot** be used between reserved characters when performing the following CLI operations:

- Add and remove tag operations. The plus ( ``+`` ) and minus  ( ``-`` ) sign characters are used to add and remove tags to and from nodes in Synapse respectively. When performing tag operations using these characters, a whitespace character cannot be used between the actual character and the tag name (e.g., ``+#<tag>``).
  
  ``storm> inet:ipv4 = 192.168.0.1 [ -#oldtag +#newtag ]``

.. _storm-literals:

Entering Literals
+++++++++++++++++

Storm uses quotation marks (single and double) to preserve whitespace and other special characters that represent literals. If values with these characters are not quoted, Synapse may misinterpret them and throw a syntax error.

Single ( ``' '`` ) or double ( ``" "`` ) quotation marks can be used when specifying a literal in Storm during an assignment or comparison operation. Enclosing a literal in quotation marks is **required** when the literal:

 - begins with a non-alphanumeric character,
 - contains a space ( ``\s`` ), tab ( ``\t`` ) or newline( ``\n`` ) character, or
 - contains a reserved Synapse character (for example, ``\ ) , = ] } |``).

Enclosing a literal in **single** quotation marks will preserve the literal meaning of **each character.** That is, each character in the literal is interpreted exactly as entered.

 - Note that if a literal (such as a string) **includes** a single quotation mark / tick mark, it must be enclosed in double quotes.
 
  - Wrong: ``'Storm's intuitive syntax makes it easy to learn and use.'``
  - Right: ``"Storm's intuitive syntax makes it easy to learn and use."``

Enclosing a literal in **double** quotation marks will preserve the literal meaning of all characters **except for** the backslash ( ``\`` ) character, which is interpreted as an 'escape' character. The backslash can be used to include special characters such as tab (``\t``) or newline (``\n``) within a literal.

 - If you need to include a literal backslash within a double-quoted literal, you must enter it as a "double backslash" (the first backslash "escapes" the following backslash character):
 
   - Wrong: ``"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"``
   - Right: ``"C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe"``
   
 Note that because the above example does not include a single quote / tick mark as part of the literal, you can simply enclose the file path in single quotes:
 
   - Also right: ``'C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe'``

The Storm queries below demonstrate assignment and comparison operations that **do not require** quotation marks:

- Lifting the domain ``vtx.lk``:
  
  ``storm> inet:fqdn = vtx.lk``

- Lifting the file name ``windowsupdate.exe``:
  
  ``storm> file:base = windowsupdate.exe``

The commands below demonstrate assignment and comparison operations that **require** the use of quotation marks. Failing to enclose the literals below in quotation marks will result in a syntax error.

- Lift the file name ``windows update.exe`` which contains a whitespace character:
  
  ``storm> file:base = 'windows update.exe'``

- Lift the file name ``windows,update.exe`` which contains the comma special character:
  
  ``storm> file:base = "windows,update.exe"``

.. _storm-op-concepts:

Storm Operating Concepts
------------------------

Storm has several notable features in the way it interacts with and operates on data. We mention these concepts briefly here to familiarize you with them; they're important but also pretty intuitive, so you don't need to worry about them too much for standard Storm queries and operations. These concepts are much more important if you're using more advanced Storm constructs such as variables or control flow, but we want to introduce the concepts here.

.. _storm-op-work-set:

Working Set
+++++++++++

Most objects in Synapse are **nodes**. Most Storm operations start by **lifting** (selecting) a node or set of nodes.

 - The set of nodes that you start with is called your **initial working set**.
 - The set of nodes at any given point in your Storm query is called your **current working set**.

.. _storm-op-chain:

Operation Chaining
++++++++++++++++++

Users commonly interact with data (nodes) in Synapse using operations such as lift, filter, and pivot. Storm allows multiple operations to be **chained** together to form increasingly complex queries:

::
  
  storm> inet:fqdn=vertex.link
  
  storm> inet:fqdn=vertex.link -> inet:dns:a
  
  storm> inet:fqdn=vertex.link -> inet:dns:a -> inet:ipv4
  
  storm> inet:fqdn=vertex.link -> inet:dns:a -> inet:ipv4 +:type=unicast

The above example demonstrates chaining a lift (``inet:fqdn=vetex.link``) with two pivots (``-> inet:dns:a``, ``-> inet:ipv4``) and a filter (``+:type=unicast``).

When Storm operations are concatenated in this manner, they are processed **in order from left to right** with each operation (lift, filter, or pivot) acting on the output of the previous operation. A Storm query is not evaluated as a single whole; Storm evaluates your working set of nodes against each operation in order before moving to the next operation.

.. NOTE::
  
  Technically, any query you construct is first evaluated as a whole **to ensure it is a syntactically valid query** - Synapse will complain if your Storm syntax is incorrect. But once Synapse has checked your Storm syntax, nodes are processed by each Storm operation in order.

You do not have to write (or execute) Storm queries "one operation at a time" - this example is simply meant to illustrate how you can chain individual Storm operations together to form longer queries. If you know that the question you want Storm to answer is "show me the unicast IPv4 addresses that the FQDN vertex.link has resolved to", you can simply run the final query. But you can also "build" queries one operation at a time if you're exploring the data or aren't sure yet where your analysis can take you.

The ability to build queries operation by operation means that a Storm query can parallel an analyst's natural thought process: you perform one Storm operation and then consider the "next step" you want to take in your analysis. "Show me X data...that’s interesting, now show me Y data that relates to X...hm, now take a subset of Y and show me any relationship to Z data..." and so on. Each "now show me..." commonly corresponds to a new Storm operation that can be added to your existing Storm query to navigate through the data.

.. _storm-node-consume:

Node Consumption
++++++++++++++++

Storm operations typically **transform** your working set in some way. That is, the nodes that "go into" (are inbound) to a given Storm operation are not necessarily the nodes that "come out" of that operation.

Take our operation chaining example above:

 - Our **initial working set** consists of the single node ``inet:fqdn=vertex.link``, which we selected with a lift operation.
 - When we pivot to the DNS A records for that FQDN, we navigate away from (drop) our initial ``inet:fqdn`` node, and navigate to (add) the DNS A nodes. Our **current working set** now consists of the DNS A records (``inet:dns:a`` nodes) for vertex.link.
 - Similarly, when we pivot to the IPv4 addresses, we navigate away from (drop) the DNS A nodes and navigate to (add) the IPv4 nodes. Our current working set is made up of the ``inet:ipv4`` nodes.
 - Finally, when we perform our filter operation, we may discard (drop) any IPv4 nodes representing non-unicast IPs (such as ``inet:ipv4=127.0.0.1``) if present.
 
We refer to this transformation (in particular, dropping) of some or all nodes by a given Storm operation as **consuming** nodes. Most Storm operations consume nodes (that is, change your working set in some way - what comes out of the operation is not the same set of nodes that goes in).
 
For standard Storm queries this process should be fairly intuitive ("now that you point that out...of course that is what's happening"). However, the idea of node consumption and the transformation of your current working set is important to keep in mind for more advanced Storm.

.. _storm-pipeline:

Storm as a Pipeline
+++++++++++++++++++

Just as each Storm **operation** in the chain is processed individually from left to right, **each node** in your working set is evaluated **individually** against a given Storm operation. You can think of your Storm query as a **pipeline** of operations, with each node "fired" one at a time through the pipeline. Whether you start with one node or 10,000 nodes, they are evaluated against your Storm query one by one.

A key advantage to processing nodes one by one is that it significantly reduces Synapse's latency and memory use - this is a big part of what makes Synapse so fast and responsive. Synapse can start providing you with results for the initial nodes processed right away, while it continues processing the remaining nodes. In other words, you don't have to wait for your entire query to complete for **all** of your nodes before getting your answer.

Again, for standard Storm, this behavior is transparent to you as the user - you run a Storm query, you get a response. However, this pipeline behavior can be important to understand when working with (or troubleshooting) Storm queries that leverage features such as subqueries, variables, or control flow operations.

.. _storm-ops-adv:

Advanced Storm Operations
-------------------------

In our experience, the more analysts use Storm, the more they want even greater power and flexibility from the language to support their analytical workflow! To meet these demands, Storm evolved a number of advanced features, including:

- Subqueries (:ref:`storm-ref-subquery`)
- Variables (:ref:`storm-adv-vars`)
- Methods (:ref:`storm-adv-methods`)
- Libraries (:ref:`storm-adv-libs`)
- Control Flow (:ref:`storm-adv-control`)

**Analysts do not need to use or understand these more advanced concepts in order to use Storm or Synapse.** Basic Storm functions are sufficient for a wide range of analytical needs and workflows. However, these additional features are available to both "power users" and developers as needed:

- For analysts, once they are comfortable with Storm basics, many of them want to expand their Storm skills **specifically because it facilitates their analysis.**
- For developers, writing extensions to Synapse in Storm has the advantage that the extension **can be deployed or updated on the fly.** Contrast this with extensions written in Python, for example, which would require restarting the system during a maintenance window in order to deploy or update the code.

.. note::

  Synapse's **Power-Ups**, which provide extended services and connections to third-party data sources, are all written in Storm and exposed to Synapse users as Storm commands!
