    "Data Model - Terminology\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This documentation presents the data model from a User or Analyst perspective. See the online documentation on Types_ and Forms_ or the Synapse source code_ for more detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that **Synapse is a distributed key-value hypergraph analysis framework.** That is, Synapse is a particular implementation of a hypergraph model, where an instance of a hypergraph is called a Cortex. In our brief discussion of graphs and hypergraphs, we pointed out some fundamental concepts related to the Synapse hypergraph implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Everything is a node.** There are no pairwise (\"two-dimensional\") edges in a hypergraph the way there are in a directed graph. While Synapse includes some edge-like nodes (digraph nodes or \"relationship\" nodes) in its data model, they are still nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tags act as hyperedges.** In a directed graph, an edge connects exactly two nodes. In Synapse, tags are labels that can be applied to an arbitrary number of nodes. These tags effectively act as an n-dimensional edge that can connect any number of nodes – a hyperedge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(Almost) every navigation of the graph is a pivot.** Since there are no pairwise edges in a hypergraph, you can’t query or explore the graph by traversing its edges. Instead, navigation primarily consists of pivoting from the properties of one set of nodes to the properties of another set of nodes. (Since tags are hyperedges, there are ways to lift by or \"pivot through\" tags to effectively perform \"hyperedge traversal\"; but most navigation is via pivots.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To start building on those concepts, you need to understand the basic elements of the Synapse data model. The fundamental terms and concepts you should be familiar with are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type_\n",
    "- Form_\n",
    "- Node_\n",
    "- Property_\n",
    "- Tag_\n",
    "\n",
    "Synapse uses a query language called **Storm** (see :ref:`storm-ref-intro`) to interact with data in the hypergraph. Storm allows a user to lift, filter, and pivot across data based on node properties, values, and tags. **Understanding these model structures will significantly improve your ability to use Storm and interact with Synapse data.**\n",
    "\n",
    ".. _data-types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "A **type** is the definition of a data element within the Synapse data model. A type describes what the element is and enforces how it should look, including how it should be normalized, if necessary, for both storage (including indexing) and representation (display).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Synapse data model supports the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base types,** which are foundational to Synapse and meant to be \"universal\" across any data model for any knowledge domain. Base types include standard types such as integers and strings, as well as common types defined within or specific to Synapse such as globally unique identifiers (``guid``), date/time values (``time``), time intervals (``ival``), and tags (``syn:tag``).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model-specific types** (or just \"types\"), which are specific to a given Synapse data model for a given knowledge domain. An object (:ref:`data-forms`) represented in the data model may itself be defined as a specific type with its own definition, normalization rules, and other constraints. In some cases, model-specific types may be extensions of base types (e.g., a U.S. Social Security Number (``gov:us:ssn``) is an extension of the integer (``int``) type with additional constraints to describe allowable format, range, etc.). In other cases, a model-specific type may be created specifically to define a given model element. For example, a fully qualified domain name (``inet:fqdn``) is its own type that is used to describe and define a domain in Synapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users typically will not interact with types directly; they are primarily used \"behind the scenes\" to define and support the Synapse data model. From a user perspective, it is important to keep the following points in mind for types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Every element in the Synapse data model must be defined as a type.** Synapse uses **forms** to define the objects that can be represented (modeled) within a Synapse hypergraph. Forms have **properties** (primary and secondary) and every property must be explicitly defined as a particular type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type enforcement is essential to Synapse’s functionality.** Type enforcement means every property is defined as a type, and Synapse enforces rules for how elements of that type can (or can’t) be created. This means (for example) that IPv4 addresses are always stored as integers (although displayed in dotted-decimal format) as opposed to integers in some cases but hex values or dotted strings in others. In addition, Synapse only allows the creation of \"sensible\" IP addresses - you can’t create an IP such as 273.42.97.426. This means that elements of the same type are always created, stored, and represented in the same way which ensures consistency and helps prevent \"bad data\" from getting into a Cortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type awareness facilitates interaction with a Synapse hypergraph.** Synapse and the Storm query language are \"model aware\" and know which types are used for each property in the model. At a practical level this allows users to use a more concise syntax when using the Storm query language because in many cases the query parser \"understands\" which navigation options make sense, given the types of the properties used in the query. It also allows users to use wildcards to pivot (see :ref:`storm-ref-pivot`) without knowing the \"destination\" forms or nodes - Synapse \"knows\" which forms can be reached from the current set of data based on types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It is still possible to navigate (pivot) between elements of different types that have the same value.** Type enforcement simplifies pivoting, but does not restrict you to only pivoting between properties of the same type. For example, the value of a Windows registry may be a string (type ``str``), but that string may represent a file path (type ``file:path``). While the Storm query parser would not automatically \"recognize\" that as a valid pivot (because the property types differ), it is possible to explicitly tell Storm to pivot from a specific ``file:path`` node to any registry value nodes whose string property value (``it:dev:regval:str``) matches that path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type-Specific Behavior\n",
    "++++++++++++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "Synapse implements various type-specific optimizations to improve performance and functionality. Some of these are \"back end\" optimizations (i.e., for indexing and storage) while some are more \"front end\" in terms of how users interact with data of certain types via Storm. See :ref:`storm-ref-type-specific` for additional detail.\n",

The uniqueness of the ``<form> = <valu>`` pair ensures there can be only one node that represents the domain ``woot.com``.

    "Every Form_ consists of (at minimum) a **primary property** that is defined as a specific Type_. Every Node_ consists of (at minimum) a primary property (its form) plus the node-specific value of the primary property (``<form> = <valu>``). In defining a form for a particular object (node), the primary property must be defined such that its value is unique across all possible instances of that form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a unique primary property is straightforward for forms that represent simple objects; for example, the \"thing\" that makes an IP address unique is the IP address itself: ``inet:ipv4 = 1.2.3.4``. Defining an appropriate primary property for more complex multidimensional nodes (such as those representing a :ref:`form-relationship` or an :ref:`form-event`) can be more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a primary property uniquely defines a node, it cannot be modified once the node is created. To \"change\" a node's primary property you must delete and re-create the node.\n",

Similarly, a Node_ includes optional secondary properties (as defined by the node's form) along with their specific values (``<prop> = <pval>``).\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary properties are characteristics that do not uniquely define a form, but may further describe or distinguish a given form and its associated nodes. For example, the Autonomous System (AS) that an IP address belongs to does not \"define\" the IP (and in fact an IP's associated AS can change), but it provides further detail about the IP address.\n",

Because a node's primary property cannot be changed once set, any secondary properties derived from the primary property also cannot be changed (i.e., are read-only).

All primary properties (i.e., forms, form names) include at least two colon-separated elements, such as ``inet:fqdn``.  The first element can be thought of as a rough \"category\" for the form (i.e., ``inet`` for Internet-related objects) with the second and / or subsequent elements defining the specific \"subcategory\" and / or \"thing\" within that category (``inet:fqdn``, ``inet:dns:query``, ``inet:dns:answer``, etc.)\n",

Secondary properties are preceded by a colon ( ``:`` ) **except for** universal properties, which are preceded by a period ( ``.`` ) to distinguish them from form-specific secodnary properties. The secondary (both universal and form-specific) properties of ``inet:fqdn`` for example would include:\n",

    "- ``inet:fqdn:zone`` (secondary property)\n",

    "Secondary properties also comprise a relative namespace / set of **relative properties** with respect to their primary property (form). In many cases the Storm query language allows you to reference a secondary property using its relative property name where the context of the relative namespace is clear (i.e., ``:zone`` vs. ``inet:fqdn:zone``).\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative properties are also used for display purposes within Synapse for visual clarity (see the `Node Example`_ above).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases secondary properties may have their own \"namespace\". Viewed another way, while both primary and secondary properties use colons (or periods for universal properties) to separate elements of the property name, not all separators represent property \"boundaries\"; some act more as name \"sub-namespace\" separators. For example ``file:bytes`` is a primary property / form. A ``file:bytes`` form may include secondary properties such as ``:mime:pe:imphash`` and ``:mime:pe:complied``.  In this case ``:mime`` and ``:mime:pe`` are not themselves secondary properties, but sub-namespaces for individual MIME data types and the \"PE executable\" data type specifically.\n",
