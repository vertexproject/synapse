    "=======================\n",
    "\n",
    "The Synapse ``csvtool`` command can be used to ingest structured data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file to create nodes in a Cortex. ``csvtool`` is useful for bulk-loading CSV-formatted data without the need to develop custom ingest code. (For other data formats such as JSON, yaml, or msgpack, see :ref:`syn-tools-feed`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``--export`` option can be used to export a set of data from a Cortex into a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm queries are used both to ingest and export data using ``csvtool``. Users should be familiar with the Storm query language (:ref:`storm-ref-intro` et al.) and the Synapse data model (:ref:`data-model-terms` et al.) in order to use ``csvtool`` effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Storm syntax used with ``csvtool`` makes use of a few more advanced Storm concepts such as variables, methods, libraries, and some programming concepts (i.e., ``for`` loops and ``switch`` statements). However, the examples below should be fairly self-explanatory. In other words, users do **not** need to understand in detail how those concepts work in order to create basic ``stormfile`` queries and start loading data using ``csvtool``.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the set of advanced Storm concepts and features can be fully leveraged within a ``stormfile`` to perform complex data ingest. Interested users are encouraged to refer to the appropriate sections of the Storm reference documents for a more detailed discussion of those concepts, which may be useful for creating more complex ``stormfile`` queries (or Storm queries in general).\n",

    "\n",
    "A CSV file (``testfile.csv``) contains a list of domains, the IP addresses the domains have resolved to, and the first and last observed times for the resolution, as represented by the example header and row data below:\n",

    ".. NOTE::\n",
    "  Because the file contains a header row, we need to use the ``--csv-header`` option to tell ``csvtool`` to skip the first row when ingesting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to load the data in the CSV file into a Cortex as a set of DNS A records (``inet:dns:a`` nodes) with the first and last dates represented as the ``.seen`` universal property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stormfile:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm references each row in the CSV file by the variable ``$rows``. We need to define a set of variables that represent each field in a row (i.e., each column in the CSV file) and tell Storm to iterate over each row using a ``for`` loop. For example:\n",

    "Typically, users will want to test that their ``stormfile`` loads and formats the data correctly by first ingesting the data into a local test cortex (``--test``) before loading the data into a production Cortex.

    "Export Examples - Overview\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``--export`` option allows you to export a set of data from a Cortex into a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When ``--export`` is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``stormfile`` contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the Storm query that specifies the data to be exported; and\n",
    "  - a statement telling Storm how to format and generate the rows of the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``csvfile`` is the location where the data should be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Storm ``$lib.csv`` library includes functions for working with CSV files. The ``$lib.csv.emit()`` function will emit CSV rows; the parameters passed to the function define the data that should be included in each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "``$lib.csv.emit()`` will create one row for each node that it processes (i.e., each node in the “pipeline” that passes through the ``$lib.csv.emit()`` command), as determined by the preceding Storm query.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. _export-1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Export Example 1\n",
    "++++++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will export the data we imported in :ref:`ingest-2`. For this simple example, we want to export the set of malicious indicators associated with the Vicious Wombat threat group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stormfile:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To lift all the indicators associated with Vicious Wombat, we can use the following Storm query:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "  \n",
    "  #cno.threat.viciouswombat\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to tell ``$lib.csv.emit()`` how to format our exported data. We want to list the indicator type (its form) and the indicator itself (the node’s primary property value).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this seems pretty straightforward, there are two considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given our example above, we have multiple node types to export (``inet:url``, ``hash:sha256``, ``inet:fqdn``).\n",
    "- While we can reference any secondary property directly using its relative property name (i.e., ``:zone`` for ``inet:fqdn:zone``), referencing the primary property value is a bit trickier, as is referencing the form of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "``$node`` is a special Storm variable that represents the **current node** passing through the Storm runtime. ``$node`` supports a number of methods that allow Storm to access various attributes of the current node. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ``$node.form()`` method will access (return) the current node’s form.\n",
    "- The ``$node.value()`` method will access (return) the current node’s primary property value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can tell ``$lib.csv.emit()`` to create a CSV file with a list of indicators as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $lib.csv.emit($node.form(), $node.value())\n",
    "\n",
    "So our overall ``stormfile`` to lift and export all of the Vicious Wombat indicators is relatively simple:\n",

    "To lift the DNS A records for the domains ``woot.com``, ``hurr.net``, and ``derp.org``, we can use the following Storm query:\n",

    "- the IP (``:ipv4`` property of the ``inet:dns:a`` node).\n",

    "- the most recently observed resolution (the second half of the ``.seen`` property).\n",

    "- The ``.seen`` values are exported using their raw Epoch millis format instead of in human-friendly datetime strings.\n",

    "*IP Address*\n",
    "\n",
    "Synapse stores IP addresses as integers, so specifying ``:ipv4`` for our output definition gives us the raw integer value for that property. If we want the human-readable value, we need to use the human-friendly representation (\"repr\") of the value. We can do this using the ``$node.repr()`` method to tell Storm to obtain and use the repr value of a node instead of its raw value (``$node.value()``).\n",
    "\n",
    "``$node.repr()`` by itself (e.g., with no parameters passed to the method) returns the repr of the primary property value of the node passing through the runtime. Our original Storm query, above, lifts DNS A records - so the nodes passing through the runtime are ``inet:dns:a`` nodes, not IPv4 nodes. This means that using ``$node.repr()`` by itself will return the repr of the ``inet:dns:a`` node, not the ``:ipv4`` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can tell ``$node.repr()`` to return the repr of a specific secondary property of the node by passing the **string** of the property name to the method:\n",

    "``.seen`` is an :ref:`type-ival` (interval) type whose property value is a paired set of minimum and maximum timestamps. To export the minimum and maximum as separate fields in our CSV file, we need to split the ``.seen`` value into two parts by assigning each timestamp to its own variable. We can do this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ($first, $last) = .seen\n",
    "\n",
    "However, simply splitting the value will result in the variables ``$first`` and ``$last`` storing (and emitting) the raw Epoch millis value of the time, not the human-readable repr value. Similar to the way in which we obtained the repr value for the ``:ipv4`` property, we need to assign the human-readable repr values of the ``.seen`` property to ``$first`` and ``$last``:\n",

    "  The data submitted to ``$lib.csv.emit()`` to create the CSV rows must exist for every node processed by the function. For example, if one of the ``inet:dns:a`` nodes lifted by the Storm query and submitted to ``$lib.csv.emit()`` does not have a ``.seen`` property, Storm will generate an error. ``csvtool`` will process nodes (and create rows in the specified ``csvfile``) up until it encounters an error, at which point it will cease processing. This may result in a partial export of the desired data.\n",
