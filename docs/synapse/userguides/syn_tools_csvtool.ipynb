    "=======================\n",
    "\n",
    "The Synapse ``csvtool`` command can be used to ingest structured data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file to create nodes in a Cortex. ``csvtool`` is useful for bulk-loading CSV-formatted data without the need to develop custom ingest code. (For other data formats such as JSON, yaml, or msgpack, see :ref:`syn-tools-feed`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``--export`` option can be used to export a set of data from a Cortex into a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm queries are used both to ingest and export data using ``csvtool``. Users should be familiar with the Storm query language (:ref:`storm-ref-intro` et al.) and the Synapse data model (:ref:`data-model-terms` et al.) in order to use ``csvtool`` effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Storm syntax used with ``csvtool`` makes use of a few more advanced Storm concepts such as variables, methods, libraries, and some programming flow control concepts (e.g., \"for\" loops and \"switch\" statements). However, the examples below should be fairly self-explanatory. In other words, users do **not** need to understand in detail how those concepts work in order to create basic ``stormfile`` queries and start loading data using ``csvtool``.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the set of advanced Storm concepts and features can be fully leveraged within a ``stormfile`` to perform complex data ingest. Interested users are encouraged to refer to the appropriate sections of the Storm reference documents for a more detailed discussion of those concepts, which may be useful for creating more complex ``stormfile`` queries (or Storm queries in general).\n",

    "--------------------------\n",

    "  When ingesting large sets of CSV-formatted data where the data has not been vetted, it may be useful to use the :ref:`edit-try` operator instead of the equivalent ( ``=`` ) operator within the Storm syntax in the ``stormfile`` used to create nodes. When using the try operator ( ``?=`` ), Storm will process what it can, creating nodes from \"well-formatted\" data and simply skipping rows that may contain bad data.\n",
    "  In contrast, using the equivalent operator ( ``=`` ) will result in Storm throwing an error and halting processing if bad data is encountered.\n",

    "**CSV File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file (``testfile.csv``) contains a list of domains, the IP addresses the domains have resolved to, and the first and last observed times for the resolution, as represented by the example header and row data below:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Stormfile:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm references the set of rows in the CSV file by the :ref:`vars-csvtool-rows` built-in variable. We need to define a set of variables (see :ref:`storm-adv-vars`) to represent each field in a row (i.e., each column in the CSV file) and tell Storm to iterate over each row using a \"for\" loop.

    "  - a statement telling Storm how to format and generate the rows of the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``csvfile`` is the location where the data should be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Storm ``$lib.csv`` library includes functions for working with CSV files. The ``$lib.csv.emit()`` function will emit CSV rows; the parameters passed to the function define the data that should be included in each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "``$lib.csv.emit()`` will create one row for each node that it processes (i.e., each node in the Storm \"pipeline\" that passes through the ``$lib.csv.emit()`` command), as determined by the preceding Storm query.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this example, we will export the data we imported in :ref:`ingest-2`. For this simple example, we want to export the set of malicious indicators associated with the Vicious Wombat threat group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stormfile:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To lift all the indicators associated with Vicious Wombat, we can use the following Storm query:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "  \n",
    "  #cno.threat.viciouswombat\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to tell ``$lib.csv.emit()`` how to format our exported data. We want to list the indicator type (its form) and the indicator itself (the node’s primary property value).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this seems pretty straightforward, there are two considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given our example above, we have multiple node types to export (``inet:url``, ``hash:sha256``, ``inet:fqdn``).\n",
    "- While we can reference any secondary property directly using its relative property name (i.e., ``:zone`` for ``inet:fqdn:zone``), referencing the primary property value is a bit trickier, as is referencing the form of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    ":ref:`vars-node-node` is a built-in Storm variable that represents the **current node** passing through the Storm pipeline. ``$node`` supports a number of methods (:ref:`storm-adv-methods`) that allow Storm to access various attributes of the current node. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The :ref:`meth-node-form` method will access (return) the current node’s form.\n",
    "- The :ref:`meth-node-value` method will access (return) the current node’s primary property value.\n",
    "\n",
