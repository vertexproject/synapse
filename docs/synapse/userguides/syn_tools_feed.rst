feed
====

The Synapse ``feed`` tool is a way to ingest data exported from one Cortex into another Cortex. Users should be familiar with both the Synapse data model (:ref:`data-model-terms` et al.) as well as Synapse concepts such as packed nodes and splices in order to use and understand the ``feed`` tool effectively.


Syntax
------
The ``feed`` tool is executed from an operating system command shell. The command usage is as follows (line is wrapped for readability):

::

  usage: synapse.tools.feed [-h] (--cortex CORTEX | --test) [--debug] [--format FORMAT] [--modules MODULES]   
    [--chunksize CHUNKSIZE] [--offset OFFSET] [files ...]

Where:
- ``-h`` displays detailed help and these command line options
- ``CORTEX``  specifies the telapth URL to the Cortex where the data should be ingested.

- ``--test`` means to perform the ingest against a temporary, local Cortex instead of a live cortex, for testing or validation
  
  - When using a temporary Cortex, you do not need to provide a path.
  
- ``--debug`` specifies to drop into an interactive prompt to inspect the state of the Cortex post-ingest.
  
- ``FORMAT`` specifies the format of the input files. 

  - Currently, only the values "syn.nodes", "syn.splices", and "syn.nodeedits" are supported.
  - Defaults to "syn.nodes" if not specified
  
- ``MODULES`` specifies a path to a Synapse CoreModule class that will be loaded into the temporary Cortex.

  - This option has no effect if the ``--test`` option is not specified
  - For more on Core Modules, see :ref:`dev_cortex_quickstart`
- ``CHUNKSIZE`` specifies how many lines or chunks of data to read at a time from the given files.

  - Defaults to 1000 if not specified

- ``OFFSET`` specifies how many chunks of data to skip over (starting at the beginning)

- ``files`` is a series of file paths containing data to load into the Cortex (or temporary Cortex)

  - Every file must be either json-serialized data, msgpack-serialized data, yaml-serialized data, or a 
    json lines file. The files do not have to all be of the same type.
  
Ingest Examples - Overview

The ``feed`` tool 

Ingest Example 1
++++++++++++++++

This example demonstrates loading a set of nodes via the ``feed`` tool with the "syn.nodes" format option. The nodes are of a variety of types, and are encoded in a json lines (jsonl) format.

**JSONL File:**

The jsonl file (``testnodes.jsonl``) contains a list of nodes in their packed form. Each line in the file corresponds to a single node, with all of the properties, tags, and nodedata on the node encoded in a json friendly format.

**Verifying the Data:**

Typically, users will want to double check the data they have before loading it into a production Cortex. The ``feed`` tool allows us to perform an ingest our of nodes file against an empty, ephemeral Cortex, so that we can check what nodes get created before slamming them into production. To load ``testnodes.jsonl`` into an ephemeral Cortex and drop into a prompt to explore the ingested nodes, run:

:: 

  python -m synapse.tools.feed --test --debug --format syn.nodes testnodes.jsonl

Assuming the command completed with no errors, we should now have a ``cmdr`` prompt connected to our test Cortex:

::

  cli>
 
From which we can issue Storm commands to interact with and validate the nodes that were just ingested. For example:

::

  cli> storm #my.cool.tag
  
  it:reveng:function=9710579930d831abd88acff1f2ecd04f
           .created = 2021/06/30 19:46:31.810
           :description = An example function
           #my.cool.tag
  inet:ipv4=23.8.47.1
           .created = 2021/06/30 19:46:31.810
           :type = unicast
           #my.cool.tag

           .created = 2021/06/30 19:46:31.810
           :base = https://synapse.docs.vertex.link/en/latest/synapse/userguide.html#userguide

           :params =

           :port = 443
           :proto = https
           #my.cool.tag

           :sha1 = 57d13f1fa2322058dc80e5d6d768546b47238fcd

           :size = 16
           #my.cool.tag
  complete. 4 nodes in 16 ms (250/sec).


**Loading the Data:**

Once we've inspected and verified the data is acceptable for loading, we can point the ``feed`` tool to the Cortex we want to load the nodes into, and the same nodes should be added.

::

  python -m synapse.tools.feed --cortex tcp://cortex.vertex.link:4444/cortex00 --format 'syn.nodes' 
    testnodes.jsonl
    
However, once we've inspected the data, let's say that the it:reveng:function and inet:ipv4 nodes are not allowed in the production Cortex, but the inet:url and file:bytes are. We can skip these two nodes by using a combination of the ``chunksize`` and ``offset`` parameters:

::

  python -m synapse.tools.feed --cortex tcp://cortex.vertex.link:4444/cortex00 --format 'syn.nodes' 
    testnodes.jsonl --chunksize 1 --offset 1
    
With the ``chunksize`` parameter signifying that the ``feed`` tool should read two lines at a time from the file and process those before reading the next line, and the ``offset`` parameter meaning the ``feed`` tool should skip all lines before and including line 1 (so lines 1 and 0) when attempting to add nodes, and only add nodes once it's read in lines 2 and beyond.

Ingest Example 2
++++++++++++++++

This example demonstrates loading a series of splices via the "syn.splices" format option. Splices are atomic edits made to the Cortex, so they are more granular, and thus more voluminous than just nodes. For instance, the storm command ``[it:host=1cad54991eaff5bba5d2015c29c3e3a3 :desc="synapse server" :name="syn007"]`` results in this set of splices (which have been saved to ``testsplices.yaml``).

      valu: 1625087167680
  ...


**Verifying the Data:**

To load ``testsplices.yaml`` into a test Cortex to see the splices getting applied, we can run the ``feed`` tool like so:

::

  python -m synapse.tools.feed --test --debug --format "syn.splice" testsplices.yaml
  
Which drops us into a ``cmdr`` prompt, where we can verify that the ``it:host`` node and ``it:hostname`` nodes were created:

::

  cli> storm it:host
  
  it:host=1cad54991eaff5bba5d2015c29c3e3a3
        .created = 2021/06/30 21:34:57.181
        :desc = synapse server
        :name = syn007
        
  complete. 1 nodes in 5 ms (200/sec).

  cli> storm it:hostname
  
  it:hostname=syn007
        .created = 2021/06/30 21:34:57.182
  complete. 1 nodes in 5 ms (200/sec).


**Loading the Data:**

As before, once the data has been inspected and approved, we can point the ``feed`` tool at the Cortex we want to apply the splices to in order to apply them.

::

    python -m synapse.tools.feed --cortex tcp://cortex.vertex.link:4444/cortex00 --format 'syn.splice' 
      testsplices.yaml
