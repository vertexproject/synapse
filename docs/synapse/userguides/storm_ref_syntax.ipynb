    "=============================================\n",

    "This section covers the following important conventions used within the Storm Reference Documents:\n",

    "- `Storm and Layers`_\n",
    "- `Storm Syntax Conventions`_\n",
    "- `Usage Statements vs. Specific Storm Queries`_\n",

    "Storm and Layers\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Storm Reference documentation provides basic syntax examples that assume a simple Storm environment - that is, a Cortex with a single Layer.** For multi-Layer Cortexes, the effects of specific Storm commands - particularly data modification commands - may vary based on the specific arrangement of read / write Layers, the Layer in which the command is executed, and the permissions of the user (see :ref:`syn-perms`). See :ref:`syn-layers` for additional details on Layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm Syntax Conventions\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Storm Reference documentation provides numerous examples of both abstract Storm syntax (usage statements) and specific Storm queries. The following conventions are used for Storm **usage statements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Items that must be entered literally on the command line are in **bold.** These items include command names and literal characters.\n",
    "- Items that represent \"variables\" that must be replaced with a name or value are placed within angle brackets ( ``< >`` ) in *italics*. Most \"variables\" are self-explanatory, however a few commonly used variable terms are defined here for convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *<form>* refers to a form / node primary property, such as ``inet:fqdn``.\n",
    "    - *<valu>* refers to the value of a primary property, such as ``woot.com`` in ``inet:fqdn=woot.com``.\n",
    "    - *<prop>* refers to a node secondary property (including universal properties) such as ``inet:ipv4:asn`` or ``inet:ipv4.created``.\n",
    "    - *<pval>* refers to the value of a secondary property, such as ``4808`` in ``inet:ipv4:asn=4808``.\n",
    "    - *<query>* refers to a Storm query.\n",
    "    - *<inet:fqdn>* refers to a Storm query whose results contain the specified form(s)\n",
    "    - *<tag>* refers to a tag (``#sometag`` as opposed to a ``syn:tag`` form).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bold brackets** are literal characters. Parameters enclosed in non-bolded brackets are optional.\n",
    "- Parameters **not** enclosed in brackets are required.\n",
    "- A vertical bar signifies that you choose only one parameter. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ``a | b`` indicates that you must choose a or b.\n",
    "    - ``[ a | b ]`` indicates that you can choose a, b, or nothing (the non-bolded brackets indicate the parameter is optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ellipses ( `...` ) signify the parameter can be repeated on the command line.\n",
    "- The ``storm`` command that must precede a Storm query is assumed and is omitted from examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**[** *<form>* **=** *<valu>* [ **:** *<prop>* **=** *<pval>* ... ] **]**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Storm query above adds a new node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outer brackets are in **bold** and are required literal characters to specify a data modification (add) operation. Similarly, the equals signs are in **bold** to indicate literal characters.\n",
    "- *<form>* and *<valu>* would need to be replaced by the specific form (such as ``inet:ipv4``) and primary property value (such as ``1.2.3.4``) for the node being created.\n",
    "- The inner brackets are not bolded and indicate that one or more secondary properties can **optionally** be specified.\n",
    "- *<prop>* and *<pval>* would need to be replaced by the specific secondary property and value to add to the node, such as ``:loc = us``.\n",
    "- The ellipsis ( ``...`` ) indicate that additional secondary properties can optionally be specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usage Statements vs. Specific Storm Queries\n",
    "-------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of specific queries represent fully literal input, but are not shown in bold for readability. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**[** *<form>* **=** *<valu>* [ **:** *<prop>* **=** *<pval>* ...] **]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[ inet:ipv4 = 1.2.3.4 :loc = us ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Type-Specific Behavior\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data types within the Synapse data model have been optimized in ways that impact their behavior within Storm queries (e.g., how types can be input, lifted, filtered, etc.) See :ref:`storm-ref-type-specific` for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitespace\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitespace may be used in the examples for formatting and readability. See the section Synapse Tools - Cmdr on :ref:`whitespace` for how whitespace is used in the Synapse CLI, including within the Storm command.\n"
