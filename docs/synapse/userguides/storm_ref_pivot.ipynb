    "\n",
    "- In many cases, pivot from tags is functionally equivalent to :ref:`lift-tag`. That is, the following queries will both return all nodes tagged with ``#aka.feye.thr.apt1``:\n",

    "  \n",
    "  ``#aka.feye.thr.apt1``\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Pivoting from tags is most useful when used in conjunction with `Pivot to Tags`_ - that is, taking a set of inbound nodes, pivoting to the ``syn:tag`` nodes for any associated tags (pivot to tags), and then pivoting out again to other nodes tagged with some or all of those tags (pivot from tags).\n",

    "Implicit Pivot Syntax\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "If the target or source property of a pivot is readily apparent - that is, given the inbound and target forms, only one set of properties makes sense for that pivot - the properties do not have to be explicitly specified. This **implicit pivot syntax** allows users to enter more concise pivot queries in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit pivot syntax can be used to pivot from a primary property to a secondary property, as well as from a secondary property to a primary property.\n",
