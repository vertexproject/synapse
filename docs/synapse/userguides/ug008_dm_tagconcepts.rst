Data Model - Tag Concepts
=========================

Recall from `Data Model – Basics`__ that the key data model components within Synapse are nodes and tags. Broadly speaking:

* **Nodes** commonly represent “facts” or “observables”: things that are objectively true or verifiable.

* **Tags** commonly represent information that may evolve over time. Most commonly, tags represent “analytical assessments”: conclusions drawn from observables that may change if data or the assessment of the data changes. In some cases, tags represent facts that may change over time. Facts that may be true for a limited period include the geolocation of an IP address or the association of an IP address with a specialized service, such as a TOR exit node or a VPN provider.

(See the section on `Secondary Properties vs. Relationship Nodes vs. Tags`__ for some general considerations when determining whether something should be represented as a node, a node property, or a tag.)

Tags can be thought of as labels applied to nodes; within the Synapse hypergraph, a given tag can be applied to any number of nodes. As such, a tag is a **hyperedge** that joins any number of arbitrary nodes into a set. Grouping nodes together in Synapse using tags is typically done to further some analytical goal.

Conversely, a node can have any number of tags applied to it, thus having any number of hyperedges or belonging to any number of analytical sets.

Tag Structure
-------------

Tags use a dotted naming convention, with the period ( . ) used as a separator character to delimit individual "components" of a tag if necessary. This dotted notation means it is possible to create **tag hierarchies** of arbitrary depth that support increasingly detailed or specific observations. For example, the top level tag ``foo`` can represent a broad set of observations, while ``foo.bar`` and ``foo.baz`` could represent subsets of ``foo`` or more specific observations related to ``foo``.

In a tag hierarchy, the full tag (down through and including the lowest or rightmost element) is known as the **leaf** tag for that hierarchy. For the tag ``foo.bar.baz``, ``foo.bar.baz`` is the leaf. The “top” or leftmost component ``foo`` may be informally referred to as the **root** of that hierarchy. The lowest (rightmost) element in a tag hierarchy is known as the **base** of the tag; for tag ``foo.bar.baz``, ``baz`` is the base.

When you apply a tag to a node, all of the tags in the tag hierarchy are applied; that is, if you apply tag ``foo.bar.baz`` to a node, Synapse automatically applies the tags ``foo.bar`` and ``foo`` as well.

When you delete a tag from a node, the tag and **all tags below it** in the hierarchy are deleted. If you delete the tag ``foo.bar.baz`` from a node, the tags ``foo.bar`` and ``foo`` will remain. However, if you delete the tag ``foo`` from a node with the tag ``foo.bar.baz``, then all three tags (``foo``, ``foo.bar``, and ``foo.bar.baz``) are deleted.

Tag Timestamps
--------------

Applying a tag to a node has a particular analytical meaning; it typically represents the recording of an assessment or judgment about the existing data within the hypergraph. Many assessments are "binary" in the sense that they are always either true or false; in these cases, the presence or absence of a tag is sufficient to accurately reflect the current analytical assessment, based on available data.

There are other cases where an assessment may be true only for a period of time or within a specified time frame. Internet infrastructure is one example; whether an IP address is part of an anonymization service (such as TOR or an anonymous VPN provider) can be annotated using tags. However, this information can change over time as the IP address is reallocated to a different provider or repurposed for another use. Although the relevant tag (for example, ``anon.vpn``) can be applied while the IP is part of an anonymous VPN service and removed when that is no longer true, completely removing the tag causes us to lose the historical knowledge that the IP was part of a VPN network **at one time.**

To address these use cases, Synapse supports the use of **timestamps** with tags. When a tag is applied to a node, optional "first seen" and "last seen" timestamps can be used to indicate "when" the condition represented by that tag was valid. The timestamps can be "pushed out" if additional data indicates the condition was true earlier or later than initially observed.

Tag timestamps represent a time **range,** and not necessarily specific occurrences (other than the "first known" and "last known" observations). This means that the assessment represented by the tag is not guaranteed to have been true throughout the entire date range. That said, the use of timestamps allows much greater granularity in recording analytical observations in cases where the timing of an assessment ("when" something was true) is relevant.

Tag Display
-----------

If any tags are applied to a node, detailed tag information will be displayed with the node properties regardless of "how" you ask about a node (e.g., ``ask`` and ``ask --props`` will display the same tag information, even though they display different details about the node properties). This includes:

* the lowest (leaf) tags (e.g., for display purposes Synapse will list ``foo.bar.baz`` but not ``foo.bar`` and ``foo``, even though they are also separate tags on the node).
* the timestamp when the tag was first applied to the node.
* the minimum / maximum times during which the tag was applicable to the node, if present.

For example::

  cli> ask inet:fqdn=woot.com

  inet:fqdn = woot.com
    #foo.bar (added 2017/06/20 19:59:02.854)
    #hurr.derp (added 2017/08/02 21:11:37.866) 2017/05/23 00:00:00.000  -  2017/08/03 00:00:00.000
  (1 results)

In the output above, the timestamps in parentheses represent when the tags ``foo.bar`` and ``hurr.derp`` were applied to the node. The additional timestamps associated with ``hurr.derp`` show the minimum / maximum range when the tag was applicable or relevant for this node.

Using the ``--raw`` option will display all tags (not just leaf tags) and properties in JSON format (timestamps are in Unix epoch time)::

  cli> ask --raw inet:fqdn=woot.com
  [
    [
      "a4d82cf025323796617ff57e884a4738",
      {
        "#foo": 1497988742854,
        "#foo.bar": 1497988742854,
        "#hurr": 1501707978035,
        "#hurr.derp": 1501708038579,
        "<#hurr.derp": 1501718400000,
        ">#hurr.derp": 1495497600000,
        "inet:fqdn": "woot.com",
        "inet:fqdn:created": 1433680424000,
        "inet:fqdn:domain": "com",
        "inet:fqdn:host": "woot",
        "inet:fqdn:sfx": 0,
        "inet:fqdn:zone": 1,
        "tufo:form": "inet:fqdn"
      }
    ]
  ]
  (1 results)

In the output above, timestamp associated with ``"#hurr.derp"`` is the time the tag was applied; the timestamps associated with ``"<#hurr.derp"`` and ``">#hurr.derp"`` are the maximum and minimum timestamps associated with the tag.

Tags - Data Model
-----------------

Tags can be thought of as labels applied to nodes. However, tags themselves are **also** nodes – that is, every tag is represented by a node (of form ``syn:tag``) within the hypergraph. For a ``syn:tag`` node, the primary property (``<form>=<value>``) is the name of the tag; so for the tag ``foo.bar``, the node’s primary property is ``syn:tag=foo.bar``.

Tag nodes can be created manually just like any other node; however, most often the creation of tag nodes is transparent to the user. That is, Synapse will create a ``syn:tag`` node on the fly when a tag is applied to a node for the first time. For example, applying the tag ``hurr.derp`` to the node ``inet:fqdn=woot.com`` will automatically create the node ``syn:tag=hurr.derp`` if it does not already exist.

Note that if you delete the **node** associated with a tag (``syn:tag=foo.bar.baz``, as opposed to deleting the tag ``foo.bar.baz`` from a node) then not only is the ``syn:tag`` node itself removed from the Cortex, but the corresponding tag is **removed from all nodes** to which it was previously applied.

From a strict data model perspective, tags are very simple since there is only one form (``syn:tag``) and one "helper" form (``syn:tagform``, the meaning of a tag when applied to a specific form) used to represent tags within the Synapse hypergraph. Any number of tags across any number of knowledge domains can be created based on those predefined forms.

Tags and tagforms are fundamental components of the Synapse data model (hence the ``syn`` prefix in ``syn:tag`` and ``syn:tagform``), independent of model elements that may be specific to a particular knowledge domain. These fundamental components are defined within the core Synapse source code (as opposed to source code for domain-specific data models). This means they are not covered by the Synapse automated document generation process, and do not appear in the standard `data model documentation`__. The form structures can be found in the source code of datamodel.py_ and are documented here (in simplified format) for reference::
   
  syn:tag

  syn:tag = <syn:tag>
    A tag or label that can be applied to one or more nodes; acts as a hyperedge to join any number of nodes into a related set.
  
  Properties:
   syn:tag:base = <str>
     The base element of the tag (right-most element; to the right of the final dot, if any. For tag foo.bar.baz, :base=baz.)
   syn:tag:up = <syn:tag>
     The portion of the tag excluding the base (all content to the left of the final dot, if any. For tag foo.bar.baz, :up=foo.bar)
   syn:tag:depth = <int>
     Number of levels down from the "top" of the tag. For tag foo.bar.baz, :depth=2. For tag foo, :depth=0.
   syn:tag:title = <str>
     The short name or definition of what the tag means.
   syn:tag:doc = <str>
     The long form description of what the tag means.
  
  
  syn:tagform
  
  syn:tagform = <syn:tagform>
    A multi-field composite type which generates a stable GUID from normalized fields. The composite type consists of the tag (syn:tag) and the form to which the tag applies (syn:prop).
  
  Properties:
   syn:tagform:tag = <syn:tag>
     The tag being documented
   syn:tagform:form = <syn:prop>
     The form that the tag applies to
   syn:tagform:title = <str>
     The short name for what the tag means when applied to the given node form.
   syn:tagform:doc = <str>
     The long form description for what the tag means when applied to the given node form.

The ``:base``, ``:up``, and ``:depth`` properties of a ``syn:tag`` node facilitate analysis using the `Storm query language`__ by supporting:

* querying or filtering at arbitrary depth;
* traversing the tag hierarchy;
* pivoting between nodes and tags.

The ``:title`` and ``:doc`` properties allow definitions for the tag and tagform to be documented on the tag node itself.
