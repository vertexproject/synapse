    "Synapse Tools - pushfile\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "The Synapse ``pushfile`` command can be used to upload files to a storage Axon (see Axon in the :ref:`devopsguide`) and optionally create an associated :ref:`type-file` node in a Cortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large-scale file ingest / upload is best performed using an automated feed / module / API. However, ``pushfile`` can be useful for uploading one-off files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "``pushfile`` is executed from an operating system command shell. The command usage is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "::\n",
    "  \n",
    "  usage: synapse.tools.pushfile [-h] -a AXON [-c CORTEX] [-r] [-t TAGS] filenames [filenames ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``AXON`` is the path to a storage Axon.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - See :ref:`cortex-connect` for the format to specify a path to an Axon and / or Cortex.\n",
    "  - Axon and Cortex paths can also be specified using aliases defined in the user's ``.syn/aliases.yaml`` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``CORTEX`` is the optional path to a Cortex where a corresponding ``file:bytes`` node should be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Note:** while this is an optional parameter, it doesn’t make much sense to store a file in an Axon that can’t be referenced from within a Cortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``TAGS`` is an optional list of tags to be applied to the ``file:bytes`` node created in the Cortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ``-t`` takes a comma separated list of tags.\n",
    "  - The tag should be specified by name only (i.e., without the ``#`` character).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- ``-r`` recursively finds all files when a glob pattern is used for a file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``filenames`` is one or more names (with optional paths), or glob patterns, to the local file(s) to be uploaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If multiple file names are specified, any tag provided with the ``-t`` option will be added to **each** uploaded file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Upload the file ``myreport.pdf`` to the specified Axon, create a ``file:bytes`` node in the specified Cortex, and tag the ``file:bytes`` node with the tag ``#sometag`` (replace the Axon and Cortex path below with the path to your Cortex. Note that the command is wrapped for readability):\n",
