    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For certain types of data, event forms and relationship forms can encode similar information but represent the difference between **instance knowledge** and **fused knowledge.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event forms represent the specific point-in-time existence of an entity or occurrence of a relationship - an **instance** of that knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationship forms can leverage the universal ``.seen`` property to set \"first observed\" and \"last observed\" times during which an entity existed or a relationship was true. This date range can be viewed as **fused** knowledge - knowledge that summarizes or \"fuses\" the data from any number of instance knowledge nodes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance knowledge and fused knowledge represent differences in data granularity. Whether to create an event form or a relationship form (or both) depends on how much detail is required for a given analytical purpose. This consideration often applies to relationships that change over time, particularly those that may change frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS A records are a good example of these differences. The IP address that a domain resolves to may change infrequently (e.g., for a website hosted on a stable server) or may change quite often (e.g., where the IP is dynamically assigned or where load balancing is used). \n",
    "\n",
    "One option to represent and track DNS A records would be to create individual timestamped forms (events) every time you check the domain’s current resolution (e.g., ``inet:dns:request`` and ``inet:dns:answer`` forms). This represents a very high degree of granularity as the nodes will record the exact time a domain resolved to a given IP, potentially down to the millisecond. The nodes can also capture additional detail such as the querying client, the responding server, the response code, and so on. However, the number of such nodes could readily reach into the hundreds of millions, if not billions, if you create nodes for every resolution of every domain you want to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative would be to decide that it is sufficient to know that a domain resolved to an IP address during a given period of time – a \"first observed\" and \"last observed\" (``.seen``) range. A single ``inet:dns:a`` node can be created to show that domain ``woot.com`` resolved to IP address ``1.2.3.4``, where the earliest observed resolution was 8/6/2014 at 13:56 and the most recently observed resolution was 5/29/2018 at 7:32. These timestamps can be extended (earlier or later) if additional data changes our observation boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This second approach loses some granularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The domain is not guaranteed to have resolved to that IP **consistently** throughout the entire time period.\n",
    "- Given only this node, we don’t know **exactly** when it the domain resolved there during that time period, outside of the earliest and most recent observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this fused knowledge may be sufficient for our needs and may be preferable to creating thousands of nodes for individual DNS resolutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a hybrid approach is also possible, where most DNS A record data is recorded in fused ``inet:dns:a`` nodes but it is also possible to record high-resolution, point-in-time nodes when needed."
