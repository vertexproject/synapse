cortex.feed
===========

The Synapse ``cortex.feed`` tool is a way to ingest data exported from one Cortex into another Cortex. Users should be familiar with both the Synapse data model (:ref:`data-model-terms` et al.) as well as Synapse concepts such as packed nodes in order to use and understand the ``cortex.feed`` tool effectively.


Syntax
------
The ``cortex.feed`` tool is executed from an operating system command shell. The command usage is as follows (line is wrapped for readability):

::

  usage: synapse.tools.cortex.feed [-h] (--cortex CORTEX | --test) [--debug] [--modules MODULES] [--chunksize CHUNKSIZE]
    [--offset OFFSET] [--view VIEW] [files ...]

Where:
- ``-h`` displays detailed help and these command line options
- ``CORTEX``  specifies the telapth URL to the Cortex where the data should be ingested.

- ``--test`` means to perform the ingest against a temporary, local Cortex instead of a live cortex, for testing or validation.
  
  - When using a temporary Cortex, you do not need to provide a path.
  
- ``--debug`` specifies to drop into an interactive prompt to inspect the state of the Cortex post-ingest.
  
- ``MODULES`` specifies a path to a Synapse CoreModule class that will be loaded into the temporary Cortex.

  - This option has no effect if the ``--test`` option is not specified

- ``CHUNKSIZE`` specifies how many lines or chunks of data to read at a time from the given files.

  - Defaults to 1000 if not specified

- ``OFFSET`` specifies how many chunks of data to skip over (starting at the beginning)

- ``VIEW`` specifies a View in the Cortex to ingest the data into.

- ``files`` is a series of file paths containing data to load into the Cortex (or temporary Cortex)

  - Every file must be either json-serialized data, msgpack-serialized data, yaml-serialized data, or a 
    json lines file. The files do not have to all be of the same type.

help
++++

The detailed help (``-h``) output for the ``cortex.feed`` tool is shown below.

.. shell:: --fail-ok python -m synapse.tools.cortex.feed -h

.. note::

  This tool was previously run using ``synapse.tools.feed``. It can still be run with that name.

Ingest Examples - Overview
--------------------------

The ``cortex.feed`` tool 

Ingest Example 1
++++++++++++++++

This example demonstrates loading a set of nodes via the ``cortex.feed`` tool. The nodes
are of a variety of types, and are encoded in a json lines (jsonl) format.

**JSONL File:**

The jsonl file (``testnodes.jsonl``) contains a list of nodes in their packed form. Each line in the file corresponds
to a single node, with all of the properties, tags, and nodedata on the node encoded in a json friendly format.

**Verifying the Data:**

Typically, users will want to double check the data they have before loading it into a production Cortex. The ``cortex.feed``
tool allows us to perform an ingest our of nodes file against an empty, ephemeral Cortex, so that we can check what
nodes get created before adding them to a production Cortex. To load ``testnodes.jsonl`` into an ephemeral Cortex and
drop into a prompt to explore the ingested nodes, run:

:: 

  python -m synapse.tools.cortex.feed --test --debug testnodes.jsonl

Assuming the command completed with no errors, we should now have a ``storm`` prompt connected to our test Cortex:

::

  storm>
 
From which we can issue Storm commands to interact with and validate the nodes that were just ingested. For example:

::

  storm> #my.cool.tag
  it:reveng:function=9710579930d831abd88acff1f2ecd04f
          :description = An example function
          .created = 2025-02-25T15:33:59.605Z
          #my.cool.tag
  inet:ip=23.8.47.1
          :type = unicast
          :version = 4
          .created = 2025-02-25T15:33:59.605Z
          #my.cool.tag

          :base = https://synapse.docs.vertex.link/en/latest/synapse/userguide.html#userguide

          :port = 443

          #my.cool.tag
  complete. 4 nodes in 4 ms (1000/sec).

**Loading the Data:**

Once we've inspected and verified the data is acceptable for loading, we can point the ``cortex.feed`` tool to the Cortex we
want to load the nodes into, and the same nodes should be added.

::

  python -m synapse.tools.cortex.feed --cortex "aha://cortex..." testnodes.jsonl
    
However, once we've inspected the data, let's say that the ``it:reveng:function`` and ``inet:ip`` nodes are not allowed in
the production Cortex, but the ``inet:url`` and ``file:bytes`` are. We can skip these two nodes by using a combination of
the ``chunksize`` and ``offset`` parameters:

::

  python -m synapse.tools.cortex.feed --cortex "aha://cortex..." testnodes.jsonl --chunksize 2 --offset 1

With the ``chunksize`` parameter signifying that the ``cortex.feed`` tool should read two lines at a time from the file and
process those before reading the next line, and the ``offset`` parameter meaning the ``cortex.feed`` tool should skip all
lines before and including line 1 (so lines 1 and 0) when attempting to add nodes, and only add nodes once it's read
in lines 2 and beyond.
