``math:algorithm:type:taxonomy``
  A hierarchical taxonomy of algorithm types.


``ou:industry:type:taxonomy``
  An industry type taxonomy.


``math:algorithm``
  A mathematical algorithm.



**************
New Properties
**************

``ou:campaign``
  The form had the following property added to it:

  ``slogan``
    The slogan used by the campaign.


``ou:org``

``risk:vulnerable``
  The form had the following properties added to it:


  ``mitigated``
    Set to true if the vulnerable node has been mitigated.


  ``mitigations``
    The mitigations which were used to address the vulnerable node.



***********
Light Edges
***********

``generates``
    When used with a ``math:algorithm`` node, the edge indicates the target
    node was generated by the algorithm.


``has``
    When used with an ``it:dev:repo`` and an ``inet:url`` node, the edge
    indicates the repo has content hosted at the URL.


``uses``
    When used with a ``risk:tool:software`` and a ``math:algorithm`` node, the
    edge indicates the tool uses the algorithm.

    When used with a ``file:bytes`` and a ``math:algorithm`` node, the edge
    indicates the file uses the algorithm.

    When used with an ``it:prod:softver`` and a ``math:algorithm`` node, the
    edge indicates the software uses the algorithm.
