Light Edges

``leaked``
  When used with a ``risk:leak`` node, the edge indicates the leak included
  the disclosure of the target node.

``leveraged``
  When used with a ``risk:extortion`` node, the edge indicates the extortion
  event was based on attacker access to the target node.

``meets``
  When used with a ``ou:requirement`` node, the edge indicates the
  requirement was met by the source node.
