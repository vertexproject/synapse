    "===================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm can be used to directly modify the Synapse hypergraph by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- adding or deleting nodes;\n",
    "- setting, modifying, or deleting properties on nodes; and \n",
    "- adding or deleting tags from nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users gain a powerful degree of flexibility and efficiency through the ability to create or modify data on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**Note:** For adding or modifying data at scale, we recommend use of the Synapse ``csvtool`` (:ref:`syn-tools-csvtool`), the Synapse ``feed`` utility (:ref:`syn-tools-feed`), or the programmatic ingest of data.)\n",
    "\n",
    ".. WARNING::\n",
    "  The ability to add and modify data directly from Storm is powerful and convenient, but also means users can inadvertently modify (or even delete) data inappropriately through mistyped syntax or premature striking of the \"enter\" key. While some built-in protections exist within Synapse itself it is important to remember that **there is no \"are you sure?\" prompt before a Storm query executes.**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The following recommended best practices will help prevent inadvertent changes to a Cortex:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Use extreme caution when constructing complex Storm queries that may modify (or delete) large numbers of nodes. It is **strongly recommended** that you validate the output of a query by first running the query on its own to ensure it returns the expected results (set of nodes) before permanently modifying (or deleting) those nodes.\n",
    "  - Use the Synapse permissions system to enforce least privilege. Limit users to permissions appropriate for tasks they have been trained for / are responsible for. See :ref:`initial-roles` in the :ref:`quickstart` guide for a basic discussion of users, roles, and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "See :ref:`storm-ref-syntax` for an explanation of the syntax format used below.\n",
    "\n",
    "See :ref:`storm-ref-type-specific` for details on special syntax or handling for specific data types (:ref:`data-type`).\n",

    "\n",
    "Edit Mode\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify data in a Cortex using Storm, you must enter “edit mode”. Edit mode makes use of several conventions to specify what changes should be made and to what data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Edit Brackets`_\n",
    "- `Edit Parentheses`_\n",
    "- `Edit \"Try\" Operator (?=)`_\n",

    "\n",
    ".. _edit-brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit Brackets\n",
    "+++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of square brackets ( ``[ ]`` ) within a Storm query can be thought of as entering edit mode. The data in the brackets specifies the changes to be made and includes changes involving nodes, properties, and tags. The only exception is the deletion of nodes, which is done using the Storm :ref:`storm-delnode` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square brackets used for the Storm data modification syntax indicate \"perform the enclosed changes\" in a generic way. The brackets are shorthand to request any of the following:\n",

    "- `Remove Tags`_\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that all of the above directives can be specified within a single set of brackets, in any combination and in any order. The only caveat is that a node must exist before it can be modified, so you must add a node inside the brackets (or lift a node outside of the brackets) before you add a secondary property or a tag.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. WARNING::\n",
    "  It is critical to remember that **the brackets are NOT a boundary that segregates nodes;** the brackets simply indicate the start and end of data modification operations. They do **NOT** separate \"nodes the modifications should apply to\" from \"nodes they should not apply to\". Storm :ref:`storm-op-chain` with left-to-right processing order still applies. **Any modification request that operates on previous Storm output will operate on EVERYTHING to the left of the modify operation, regardless of whether those nodes are within or outside the brackets.** The only exception is modifications that are placed within :ref:`edit-parens`.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. NOTE::\n",
    "  For simplicity, syntax examples below demonstrating how to add nodes, modify properties, etc. only use edit brackets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Edit Parentheses\n",
    "++++++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of :ref:`edit-brackets`, Storm supports the use of edit parentheses ( ``( )`` ). Edit parentheses (\"parens\") are used to explicitly limit a set of modifications to a specific node or nodes by enclosing the node(s) and their associated modification(s) within the parentheses. This \"overrides\" the default behavior for edit brackets, which is that every change specified within the brackets applies to every node generated by the previous Storm output (i.e., every node in the Storm pipeline), whether the node is referenced inside or outside the brackets themselves. Edit parens thus allow you to make limited changes \"inline\" with a more complex Storm query instead of having to use a smaller, separate query to make those changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to edit brackets, a node must exist or be specified before it can be modified, so the data within edit parens must start with the lift or creation of one or more nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, multiple sets of edit parens can be used within a single set of edit brackets; each set of edit parens will delimit a separate set of edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "See :ref:`data-mod-combo` below for examples showing the use of edit brackets with and without edit parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. _edit-try:\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit \"Try\" Operator (?=)\n",
    "++++++++++++++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "Most edit operations will involve explicitly setting a primary or secondary property value using the equivalent ( ``=`` ) comparison operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "``[ inet:fqdn = woot.com ]``\n",
    "\n",
    "``inet:ipv4 = 1.2.3.4 [ :asn = 444 ]``\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm also supports the optional \"try\" operator ( ``?=`` ) within edit brackets or edit parens. The try operator will **attempt** to set a value that may or may not pass :ref:`data-type` enforcement for that property. Similarly, the try operator can also be used when setting tags, e.g. ``[ +?#mytag ]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrectly specifying a property value is unlikely to occur for users entering Storm data modification queries at the command line (barring outright user error), as users are directly vetting the data they are entering. However, the try operator may be useful for Storm-based automated ingest of data (such as :ref:`syn-tools-csvtool` or :ref:`syn-tools-feed`) where the data source may contain \"bad\" data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of the try operator allows Storm to fail silently in the event it encounters a ``BadTypeValu`` error (i.e., skip the bad event but continue processing). Contrast this behavior with using the standard equivalent operator ( ``=`` ), where if Storm encounters an error it will halt processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the :ref:`type-array` section of the :ref:`storm-ref-type-specific` for specialized \"edit try\" syntax when working with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoadds and Depadds\n",
    "++++++++++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "Synapse makes use of two optimization features when adding nodes or setting secondary properties: automatic additions (:ref:`gloss-autoadd`) and dependent additions (:ref:`gloss-depadd`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autoadd** is the process where, on node creation, Synapse will automatically set any secondary properties that are derived from a node's primary property. Because these secondary properties are based on the node's primary property (which cannot be changed once set), the secondary properties are read-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depadd** is the process where, on setting a node's secondary property value, if that property is of a type that is also a form, Synapse will automatically create the form with the corresponding primary property value. (You can view this as the secondary property \"depending on\" the existing of a node with the corresponding primary property.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoadd and depadd work together (and recursively) to simplify adding data to a Cortex. Properties set via autoadd may result in the creation of nodes via depadd; the new nodes may have secondary properties set via autoadd that result in the creation of additional nodes via depadd, and so on.\n",

    "- Deleting a leaf tag deletes **only** the leaf tag from the node. For example, ``[ -#foo.bar.baz ]`` will delete the tag ``#foo.bar.baz`` but leave the tags ``#foo.bar`` and ``#foo`` on the node.\n",
    "- Deleting a non-leaf tag deletes that tag and **all tags below it in the tag hierarchy** from the node. For example, ``[ -#foo ]`` used on a node with tags ``#foo.bar.baz`` and ``#foo.hurr.derp`` will remove **all** of the following tags:\n",
