=========

The Synapse ``axon.copy`` tool can be used to copy blobs from one Axon to another Axon.

Syntax
------

``copy`` is executed using ``python -m synapse.tools.axon.copy``. The command usage is as follows:

.. shell:: --fail-ok python -m synapse.tools.axon.copy -h

.. note::

  This tool was previously run using ``synapse.tools.axon2axon``. It can still be run with that name.
