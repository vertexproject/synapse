service.backup
==============

The Synapse ``service.backup`` tool can be used to create an optimized backup of a Synapse directory.

Syntax
------

``service.backup`` is executed using ``python -m synapse.tools.service.backup``. The command usage is as follows:

.. shell:: --fail-ok python -m synapse.tools.service.backup -h

.. note::

  This tool was previously run using ``synapse.tools.backup``. It can still be run with that name.
