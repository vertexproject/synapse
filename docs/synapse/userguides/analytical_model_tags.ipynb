    "Tags (``syn:tag`` forms) have a number of type-specific behaviors within Synapse with respect to how they are indexed, created, and manipulated via Storm. Most important for practical purposes is that ``syn:tag`` nodes are created \"on the fly\" when a tag is applied to another node. That is, the ``syn:tag`` node does not need to be created manually before the tag can be used; the act of applying a tag will cause the creation of the appropriate ``syn:tag`` node (or nodes).\n",

    "\n",
    "Synapse does not include any pre-populated tags (``syn:form = <tag>``), just as it does not include any pre-populated domains (``inet:fqdn = <domain>``). Because tags can be highly specific to both a given knowledge domain and to the type of analysis being done within that domain, organizations have the flexibility to create a tag structure that is most useful to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tag node's value (``syn:tag = <valu>``) is simply a string and can be set to any user-defined alphanumeric value. However, the strings are designed to use a dotted naming convention, with the period ( ``.`` ) used as a separator character to delimit individual elements of a tag if necessary. This dotted notation means it is possible to create tag hierarchies of arbitrary depth that support increasingly detailed or specific observations. For example, the top level tag ``foo`` can represent a broad set of observations, while ``foo.bar`` and ``foo.baz`` could represent subsets of ``foo`` or more specific observations related to ``foo``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this hierarchy, specific terms are used for the tag and its various components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Leaf tag:** The full tag path / longest tag in a given tag hierarchy.\n",
    "- **Root tag:** The top / leftmost element in a given tag hierarchy.\n",
    "- **Base tag:** The bottom / rightmost element in a given tag hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the tag ``foo.bar.baz``:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``foo.bar.baz`` is the leaf tag / leaf.\n",
    "- ``foo`` is the root tag / root.\n",
    "- ``baz`` is the base tag / base.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you apply a tag to a node, all of the tags **above** that tag in the tag hierarchy are automatically applied as well (and the appropriate ``syn:tag`` forms are created if they do not exist). That is, when you apply tag ``foo.bar.baz`` to a node, Synapse automatically applies the tags ``foo.bar`` and ``foo`` as well. Because tags are meant to be hierarchical, if the specific assessment ``foo.bar.baz`` is applicable to a node and ``foo.bar.baz`` is a subset of ``foo``, it follows that the broader assessment ``foo`` is applicable as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you delete (remove) a tag from a node, the tag and all tags **below** it in the hierarchy are deleted. If you delete the tag ``foo.bar.baz`` from a node, the tags ``foo.bar`` and ``foo`` will remain. However, if you delete the tag ``foo`` from a node with the tag ``foo.bar.baz``, then all three tags (``foo``, ``foo.bar``, and ``foo.bar.baz``) are deleted.\n",

    "Tag Timestamps\n",
    "++++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying a tag to a node has a particular meaning; it typically represents the recording of an assessment about that node with respect to the existing data in the Cortex. Many assessments are binary in the sense that they are either always true or always false; in these cases, the presence or absence of a tag is sufficient to accurately reflect the current analytical assessment, based on available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other cases where an assessment may be true only for a period of time or within a specified time frame. Internet infrastructure is one example; whether an IP address is part of an anonymization service such as Tor can be annotated using tags (e.g., ``cno.infra.anon.tor``). However, this information can change over time as the IP address is reallocated to a different client or repurposed for another use. Although the relevant tag can be applied while the IP is a Tor node and removed when that is no longer true, completely removing the tag causes us to lose the historical knowledge that the IP was a Tor node **at one time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these use cases, Synapse supports the optional use of **timestamps** (technically, time intervals) with tags applied to nodes. These timestamps can represent \"when\" (first known / last known times) the **assessment represented by the tag** was relevant for the node to which the tag is applied. (These timestamps are analogous to the ``.seen`` universal property that can be used to represent the first and last known times the **data represented by a node** was true / real / in existence.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying a timestamp to a tag affects that specific tag only. The timestamps are not automatically propagated to tags higher up (or lower down) in the tag tree. This is because the specific tag to which the timestamps are applied is the most relevant with respect to those timestamps; tags elsewhere in the tree may have different shades of meaning and the timestamps may not apply to those tags in the same way (or at all).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like ``.seen`` properties, tag timestamps represent a time **range** and not necessarily specific instances (other than the \"first known\" and \"last known\" observations). This means that the assessment represented by the tag is not guaranteed to have been true throughout the entire date range (though depending on the meaning of the tag, that may in fact be the case). That said, the use of timestamps allows much greater granularity in recording analytical observations in cases where the timing of an assessment (\"when\" something was true or applicable) is relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example - Tor Exit Nodes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many web sites provide lists of Tor nodes or allow users to query IP addresses to determine whether they are Tor nodes. These sites may provide a \"first seen\" date for when the IP was first identified as part of the Tor network. The \"first seen\" date and date the site was queried (assuming the site status is current) can be used as timestamps for \"when\" the tag ``cno.infra.anon.tor`` was applicable to that IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a data source that verifies that IP address ``197.231.221.211`` was a Tor exit node between December 19, 2017 and February 15, 2019, we can apply the tag ``#cno.anon.tor.exit`` with the appropriate time range as follows:"
