    "========================\n",

    "The Synapse ``genpkg`` tool can be used to generate a Storm :ref:`gloss-package` containing new Storm commands and Storm modules from a YAML prototype and optionally push it to a Cortex or PkgRepo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "``genpkg`` is executed from an operating system command shell. The command usage is as follows:\n",

    "::\n",
    "\n",
    "  usage: synapse.tools.genpkg [-h] [--push <url>] [--save <path>] [--optic <path>] <pkgfile>\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``pkgfile`` is the path to the Storm Package YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``--save`` takes a file name to save the completed package JSON as.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``--push`` takes an optional Telepath URL to a Cortex or PkgRepo for the package to be pushed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - See :ref:`cortex-connect` for the format to specify a path to a Cortex.\n",
    "  - Cortex paths can also be specified using aliases defined in the user's ``.syn/aliases.yaml`` file.\n",
