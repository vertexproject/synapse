    "\n",
    "When leveraging variables in Storm, it is important to keep in mind the high-level :ref:`storm-op-concepts`. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storm operations (e.g., lifts, filters, pivots, etc.) are performed on **nodes.**\n",
    "- Operations can be **chained** and are executed in order from left to right.\n",
    "- Storm acts as an **execution pipeline,** with each node passed individually and independently through the chain of Storm operations.\n",
    "- Most Storm operations **consume** nodes — that is, a given operation (such as a filter or pivot) acts upon the inbound node in some way and returns only the node or set of nodes that result from that operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles apply to variables that reference nodes (or node properties) in Storm just as they apply to nodes, and so affect the way variables behave within Storm queries.\n",

    "Variable Scope\n",
    "++++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable’s **scope** is its lifetime and under what conditions it may be accessed. There are two dimensions that impact a variable’s scope: its **call frame** and its **runtime safety** (\"runtsafety\").\n",
    "\n",
    ".. _var-call-frame:\n",
    "\n",
    "Call Frame\n",
    "++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable’s **call frame** is where the variable is used. The main Storm query starts with its own call frame, and each call to a \"pure\" Storm command, function, or subquery creates a new call frame. The new call frame gets a copy of all the variables from the calling call frame. Changes to existing variables or the creation of new variables within the new call frame do not impact the calling scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtsafe vs. Non-Runtsafe\n",
    "+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n",
    "\n",
    "An important distinction to keep in mind when using variables in Storm is whether the variable is runtime-safe (\":ref:`gloss-runtsafe`\") or non-runtime safe (\":ref:`gloss-non-runtsafe`\").\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable that is **runtsafe** has a value independent of any nodes passing through the Storm pipeline. For example, a variable whose value is explicitly set, such as ``$string = mystring`` or ``$ipv4 = 8.8.8.8``  is considered runtsafe because the value does not change / is not affected by the specific node passing through the Storm pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable that is **non-runtsafe** has a value derived from a node passing through the Storm pipeline. For example, a variable whose value is set to a node property value may change based on the specific node passing through the Storm pipeline. In other words, if your Storm query is operating on a set of DNS A nodes (``inet:dns:a``) and you define the variable ``$fqdn = :fqdn`` (setting the variable to the value of the ``:fqdn`` secondary property), the value of the variable will change based on the specific value of that property for each ``inet:dns:a`` node in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "All non-runtsafe variables are **scoped** to an individual node as it passes through the Storm pipeline. This means that a variable’s value based on a given node is not available when processing a different node (at least not without using special commands, methods, or libraries). In other words, the path of a particular node as it passes through the Storm pipeline is its own scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"safe\" in non-runtsafe should **not** be interpreted as meaning the use of non-runtsafe variables is somehow \"risky\" or involves insecure programming or processing of data. It simply means the value of the variable is not safe from changing (i.e., it may change) as the Storm pipeline progresses.\n",
