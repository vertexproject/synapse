Note that a file can be represented as a node within a Cortex regardless of whether the file itself (the specific set of bytes) is available (i.e., stored in an Axon). This is essential as many other data model elements allow (or depend on) the concept of a file (as opposed to a hash).\n",

MD5 collisions can now be generated with ease, and SHA1 collisions were demonstrated in 2017. For this reason, Synapse uses the SHA256 hash of a file (considered sufficiently immune from collision attacks for the time being) as \"unique enough\" to act as the primary property of a ``file:bytes`` node if available.

    "\n",
    "- **Top-level country code domains and their subdomains.** Under Synapse’s default logic ``uk`` is a suffix and ``co.uk`` is a zone. However, ``co.uk`` could **also** be considered a suffix in its own right, because subdomains such as ``somecompany.co.uk`` are under the control of the organization that registers them. In this case, ``uk`` would be a suffix, ``com.uk`` could be considered both a suffix **and** a zone, and ``somecompany.co.uk`` could be considered a zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special-case zones of control.** Some domains (such as those used to host web-based services) can be considered specialized zones of control. In these cases, the service provider typically owns the \"main\" domain (such as ``wordpress.com``) but individual customers can register personal subdomains for their hosted services (such as ``joesblog.wordpress.com``). The division between ``wordpress.com`` and individual customer subdomains could represent different zones of control. In this case, ``com`` would be a suffix, ``wordpress.com`` could be considered both a suffix **and** a zone, and ``joesblog.wordpress.com`` could be considered a zone.\n",
    "\n",
