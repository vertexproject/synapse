In this case, ``uk`` would be a suffix, ``com.uk`` could be considered both a suffix **and** a zone, and ``somecompany.co.uk`` could be considered a zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special-case zones of control.** Some domains (such as those used to host web-based services) can be considered specialized zones of control. In these cases, the service provider typically owns the \"main\" domain (such as ``wordpress.com``) but individual customers can register personal subdomains for their hosted services (such as ``joesblog.wordpress.com``). The division between ``wordpress.com`` and individual customer subdomains could represent different zones of control. In this case, ``com`` would be a suffix, ``wordpress.com`` could be considered both a suffix **and** a zone, and ``joesblog.wordpress.com`` could be considered a zone.\n",
