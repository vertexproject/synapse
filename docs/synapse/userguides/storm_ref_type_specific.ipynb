    "The reverse hierarchy implicit in dotted FQDNs represents elements such as *<host>.<domain>.<suffix>*, but can also represent implicit or explicit **zones of control.** The term \"zone of control\" is loosely defined, and is not meant to represent control or authority by any specific organization or entity. Instead, \"zone of control\" can be thought of as a boundary within an individual FQDN hierarchy where control of a portion of the domain namespace shifts from one entity or owner to another.\n",

    "This logic works well for single-element top-level domains (TLDs) (such as ``com`` vs ``microsoft.com``). However, it  does not address cases that may be relevant for certain types of analysis, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top-level country code domains and their subdomains.** Under Synapse’s default logic ``uk`` is a suffix and ``co.uk`` is a zone. However, ``co.uk`` could **also** be considered a suffix in its own right, because subdomains such as ``somecompany.co.uk`` are under the control of the organization that registers them. In this case, ``uk`` would be a suffix, ``com.uk`` could be considered both a suffix **and** a zone, and ``somecompany.co.uk`` could be considered a zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special-case zones of control.** Some domains (such as those used to host web-based services) can be considered specialized zones of control. In these cases, the service provider typically owns the \"main\" domain (such as ``wordpress.com``) but individual customers can register personal subdomains for their hosted services (such as ``joesblog.wordpress.com``). The division between ``wordpress.com`` and individual customer subdomains could represent different zones of control. In this case, ``com`` would be a suffix, ``wordpress.com`` could be considered both a suffix **and** a zone, and ``joesblog.wordpress.com`` could be considered a zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples such as these are **not accounted for** by Synapse’s suffix / zone logic. The definition of additional domains as suffixes and / or zones is an implementation decision (though once the relevant properties are set, the changes are propagated recursively as noted above).\n",
