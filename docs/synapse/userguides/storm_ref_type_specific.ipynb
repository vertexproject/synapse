    "**Usage Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The standard \"edit try\" operator ( ``?=`` ) can optionally be used when setting the **full** value of an array property (vs. adding or removing an element from an array). Note that if **any** value in the list of values fails (e.g., does not pass type enforcement), setting the **entire** property will fail. For example, attempting to set ``[ :identities:emails?=(alice@vertex.link, bob) ]`` on an X509 certificate (``crypto:x509:cert``) will fail to set the property altogether because ``bob`` is not a valid email address type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"edit try\" operator for **removing** individual elements from an array ( ``?-=`` ) is unique to arrays as they are the only type that allows removal of a single element from a property (properties with a single value are either set / modified, or the property is deleted altogether). As with other uses of \"edit try\", use of the operator allows the operation to silently fail (vs. error and halt) if the operation attempts to remove a value from an array that does not match the array's defined type. For example, attempting to remove an IPv4 from an array of email addresses will halt with a ``BadTypeValu`` error if the standard remove operator ( ``-=``) is used, but silently fail (do nothing and continue) if the \"edit try\" version ( ``?-=``) is used."

MD5 collisions can now be generated with ease, and SHA1 collisions were demonstrated in 2017. For this reason, Synapse uses the SHA256 hash of a file (considered sufficiently immune from collision attacks for the time being) as \"unique enough\" to act as the primary property of a ``file:bytes`` node if available.
