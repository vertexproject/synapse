    "Storm Reference - Storm Commands\n",
    "================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Storm commands are built-in or custom commands that can be used with the Synapse :ref:`syn-storm` command itself. As such, Storm commands must be executed following the ``storm`` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "**storm** *<command>*\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "**storm** *<query>* **|** *<command>* [ **|** *<query>* ]\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipe symbol ( ``|`` ) is used to send (pipe) the output from a Storm query to any of the Storm commands, and to send the output from a Storm command back to a Storm query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Built-in commands** are native to the Storm library and loaded by default within a given Cortex. Built-in commands comprise a set of helper commands that perform a variety of specialized tasks that are useful regardless of the types of data stored in the Cortex or the types of analysis performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom commands** are Storm commands that have been added to a Cortex to invoke the execution of dynamically loaded modules. Dynamically loaded modules are typically custom modules that have been added to Synapse to support domain-specific analysis. For example, a knowledge domain that requires tracking of IP addresses might have access to a third-party service such as Maxmind to obtain up-to-date data on the assigned Autonomous System (AS) or geographical location of a given IP address. A custom ``maxmind`` module and associated Storm command could be added to Synapse to query the Maxmind database and update the appropriate secondary properties on the associated ``inet:ipv4`` nodes directly from Storm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of storm commands (built-in and custom) available in a given Cortex can be displayed with ``storm help``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help for a specific Storm command can be displayed with ``storm <command> --help``.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section details the usage and syntax for built-in Storm commands. Many of the commands below, such as ``count``, ``limit``, ``max`` / ``min``, or ``delnode``, directly support analyst tasks within Storm. Other commands, such as those used to manage daemons, queues, packages, or services, may be primarily of interest to Syanpse administrators or developers.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ``delnode`` operates on the output of a previous Storm query.\n",
    "- ``delnode`` will attempt to perform some basic sanity-checking to help prevent egregious mistakes. For example, ``delnode`` will return an error if you attempt to delete a node that is still referenced by another node (such as an ``inet:fqdn`` that is referenced by an ``inet:dns:a`` node). Similarly, delnode will return an error if you attempt to delete a ``syn:tag`` node if that tag is still applied to other nodes. **However, delnode cannot prevent all mistakes.**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Edge / digraph nodes (such as ``edge:refs`` or ``edge:has``) are **exempt** from these \"reference checks\". It is possible to delete an edge node where ``n1`` and / or ``n2`` still exist and without affecting ``n1`` or ``n2``. This is generally desired behavior as the relationship between the nodes (the edge) may need to be removed without affecting the nodes themselves.\n",
    "  - However, the opposite is also true - since ``delnode`` does not check for references to edge nodes when deleting nodes, it is possible leave \"orphaned\" edge nodes with a missing ``n1`` or ``n2``.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ``--force`` parameter will forcibly delete the nodes input to the command, regardless of any sanity-checking errors or other conditions. **This parameter should be used with extreme caution as it may result in broken references within the Cortex.**"

In other words, the result of the above command will be that nodes previously tagged ``aka.fireeye.malware`` will now be tagged both ``aka.feye.mal`` **and** ``aka.fireeye``.
