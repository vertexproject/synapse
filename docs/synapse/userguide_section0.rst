The following sections are still under development:

- Storm Reference
- Storm Tutorial

Many of the concepts above are closely interrelated, and the outline above represents a reasonable effort at introducing concepts in a logical order. However, it is difficult to fully understand the potential of Synapse and hypergraphs without grasping the power of the Storm query language to understand, manipulate, and annotate data. Similarly, itâ€™s hard to understand the effectiveness of Storm without knowledge of the underlying data model. **The outline above is our suggested order, but readers are encouraged to skip around, or revisit earlier sections after digesting later sections to better see how these topics are tied together.**
