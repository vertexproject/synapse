    "Synapse Performance - 3\n",
    "=======================\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring the performance of a synapse cortex is a complex undertaking which depends\n",
    "not only on the test configurations, but the \"shape\" of the data being ingested and\n",
    "queried.  These tests attempt to take an accurate measure of a set of \"bookend\" data sets\n",
    "selected specifically to demonstrate best case and worst case ingest performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Note on Comparisons\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It doesn't matter that a 747 can carry more passengers than the Space Shuttle, when the mission\n",
    "is to repair a satellite\" -visi\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing these numbers to benchmarks published by various big data systems such\n",
    "as Hadoop and Elastic Search, it is critical to keep in mind the fundamental difference\n",
    "between a knowledge system like a synapse cortex versus a simple indexer such as Elastic Search.\n",
    "A knowledge system is required to deconflict all new data against what is already known.  This\n",
    "means for each new node added to the hypergraph, it must atomically determine if that node already\n",
    "exists so there is only ever one node which represents a particular thing.  While many big data\n",
    "systems claim this type of ACID compliant deconfliction is possible, our testing has shown that\n",
    "the claimed performance of these types of systems is drastically reduced when required to carry\n",
    "out atomic check-and-add operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is also an advantage for a deconflicted knowledge system.  When encountering a node\n",
    "which has been previously observed, the system does not create a new node.  This has the counterintuitive\n",
    "effect of making a cortex typically become faster as it ingests more data.  This performance\n",
    "increase is especially true when ingesting data with many recurrent nodes.\n",

    "The Majestic Million is a ranked list of a million FQDNs which is freely\n",

    "\n",
    "This dataset was selected for performance benchmarking due to it being a \"worst case\" bookend.\n",
    "Within a cortex, inet:fqdn nodes undergo extensive normalization and often the creation of one\n",
    "inet:fqdn node causes the creation of several others.  For example, creating inet:fqdn=www.woot.com\n",
    "would subsequently cause the creation of inet:fqdn=woot.com and inet:fqdn=com.  Additionally, the\n",
    "FQDNs within the Majestic Million dataset are already deconflicted, meaning each FQDN only occurs\n",
    "once within the dataset.  This causes every record to deconflict and create new nodes.\n",

    "````````````````\n",
    "\n",
    "A synapse cortex is also capable of ingestion and indexing of \"instance knowledge\" which is not\n",
    "typically deconflicted.  The primary property for such nodes is typically a system generated GUID\n",
    "and insert times are typically higher.  This test is intended to be close to a \"best case\" scenario\n",
    "where node insertion is not being atomically deconflicted and node properties are not subject\n",
    "to extensive normalization rules.\n",

    "Cortex Configurations\n",

    "tests are executed with minimal or no specialized configuration in an attempt to show performance\n",
    "capabilities without the use of exotic configuration.  All cortex instances are configured without\n",
    "caching in an attempt to measure the speed of the storage layer implementations rather than the\n",
    "caching subsystem.  A production cortex configured with caches is likely to perform queries much\n",
