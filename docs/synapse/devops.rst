Synapse DevOps Guide
####################

This DevOps Guide is written by and for Synapse developers and operators. This is focused towards individuals who are
looking to deploy Synapse (such as Cortex Hypergraphs or Axon blob stores); looking to use Synapse components in their
own projects; or those looking to contribute back to the Synapse project.

The DevOps Guide is a living document and will continue to be updated and expanded. The current sections are:
