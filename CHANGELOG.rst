v0.2.0 - 2020-xx-xx
===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Refactored Layer Storage Format

This release includes significant storage optimizations for both performance and size.  However, the `0.2.0` migration
contains no *model* migrations and is strictly limited to the internal LMDB layer storage format.  The new format
provides performance enhancements that significantly improve data ingest performance and reduce the memory footprint of
the layer.  See :ref:`020_migration` for details on migrating your `0.1.x` Cortex to `0.2.0`.

- View/Layer Management

Views and layers may now be managed via simple storm commands or manipulated by the storm API.  Additionally,
permissions may be assigned on a per-view or per-layer basis allowing granular control of users and roles.
With proper permission, a view may now be easily forked to create an analyst owned "sandbox" where their edits are
written to a separate layer which can later be merged by someone with appropriate permissions.  A user
may now set a "default view" profile option to specify the view to be used when they issue a default storm query.

- Mirrors Are Now A Fully Operational Battle Station

Previous support for Cortex "mirrors" has been limited to mirroring data from a single layer.  The mechanism for change
control and distribution within a Cortex has been updated to facilitate true mirroring of all changes within a Cortex.
Each change within a Cortex is assigned a sequential identifier which allows mirrors to be taken offline and catch-up
once they are returned to operation.  Additionally, mirrors have been updated to facilitate "write-back" edits which
propagate changes via their upstream mirror, making the mirror appear writable.  With this new mechanism, a set of
mirrors may be configured to handle read offloading as well as write consolidation.

- Cron/Trigger Management

Cron jobs and triggers may now be managed via simple storm commands or manipulated by the storm API.  Additionally,
permissions are now enforced on a per-object basis.

- Experimental Spawn Runtime Improvements

The (still experimental) ``spawn: True`` option to the storm runtime, which facilitates execution of a storm query in a
sub-process, has made progress toward feature parity.  Specifically, a number of storm library APIs have been updated to
facilitate access from within a spawned sub-process transparently.  While the spawn option is still considered
experimental, it has reached a level of maturity which may warrant review due to the powerful performance benefit for
large or long running read queries.

Backward Compatibility Breaks
-----------------------------

Modified Node Permission Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    Node permissions were modified to allow all basic node edits to fall within a single hierarchy in order to
    facilitate easily granting permissions for all node edits.

    The following permission table provides translation:

    ============== ==============
    Old Permission New Permission
    ============== ==============
    node:add       node.add
    node:del       node.del
    prop:set       node.prop.set
    prop:del       node.prop.del
    \tag:add       node.tag.add
    \tag:del       node.tag.del
    ============== ==============

Why make the change
    By placing all node edit permissions under a single hierarchy, administrators may easily grant access to all node
    modifications by adding the permission ``node``.  As previously, more granular versions of the given permissions are
    available to individually control access.

What you need to do
    The Synpase ``0.2.x`` migration tool should take care of translating all relevant permissions changes within a
    migrated Cortex.  However, any 3rd party code that modifies permissions should be updated to the new naming
    convention.

Node Edits vs Splices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    The various splice events provided by the storm runtime have been consolidated and streamlined into a single
    ``node:edits`` event type.  The new ``node:edits`` events contain a more compressed and aggregated representation of
    node changes and include changes that were previous unreported.  Callers may now specify the format for the node
    edits reported by the storm runtime by using the ``editformat`` optional parameter to the storm runtime, but the
    default output will now be ``node:edits`` rather than splices.  The following table enumerates the options for the
    ``editformat`` parameter:

    ========== =========================================================
    editformat Storm runtime behavior
    ========== =========================================================
    nodeedits  Provide new ``node:edits`` events.
    splices    Provide ``0.1.x`` backward-compatible splice events.
    count      Provide ``node:edits:count`` events with simple counts.
    none       Do not transmit any representation for node edits.
    ========== =========================================================

Why make the change
    The splice format was originally designed to facilitate a single atomic edit per-splice.  As such, it required the
    potentially large primary property value to be embedded in each splice.  When making multiple edits, this
    representation is inefficient and causes the retransmission, and potential storage, of duplicate data.
    Additionally, the key-value structure of the splice format provided unnecessary extensibility at the cost of
    transmission/storage size.

What you need to do
    Update any code that consumes/indexes the various splice events to handle the new ``node:edits`` format.
    Additionally, callers may specify ``editformat: "splices"`` within their storm runtime options to enable
    backward-compatible splice generation. External APIs for retrieving splices have been marked as deprecated and will
    be removed in v0.3.0.

Removed Remote Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    Support for remote layers has been removed.

Why make the change
    The performance characteristics and stability of remote layers has never reached what we consider production
    deployable status.  Additionally, complexities with model versions, migrations, and model synchronization have made
    the use of remote layers highly fragile.  While we may eventually design a new remote layer capability, the current
    implementation is being removed due to being unsupportable.

What you need to do
    If you have remote layers deployed in production, you should update the view configuration to contain an "upstream"
    layer.  This will create a copy of the remote layer data to the local Cortex and keep it in sync.

Removed Pushing Splices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    The configuration options to enable pushing splices to a cryotank or to another cortex have been removed.

Why make the change
    The archival of splices to a cryotank and the responsibility of a Cortex to "push" changes to another Cortex have
    long been essentially vestigial.  Additionally, these options required a Cortex reboot to take effect and were not
    runtime configurable.  The current mechanisms for mirroring and upstream layers allow for a more scalable and
    dynamic configuration.

What you need to do
    It is unlikely that this change will effect any known deployments.

Removed Monolithic Feed Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    The monolithic configuration option for pulling "feed" data from a Cryotank has been removed.

Why make the change
    The ability to feed a Cortex directly from a Cryotank represents a very early approach to automate data ingest into
    a Cortex.  This capability has been superseded by Storm Services which provide a dynamically configurable way to
    integrate services and data.

What you need to do
    It is unlikely that this change will effect any known deployments.

Removed Tag Prop Lifting Without Tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    The ability to lift nodes by the presence of a tag property *without* specifying the tag name has been removed.
    Given a tag property of "confidence", the ``#:confidence`` and ``#:confidence>90`` style syntax are no longer valid.
    However, lifting by tag property *with* the tag, such as ``#foo.bar:confidence`` and ``#foo.bar:confidence>90``
    remain valid.

Why make the change
    The necessary indexing to provide a performant way to lift nodes by the tag property without the tag is too
    expensive for the analytically dubious use case.

What you need to do
    Any instances of lifting nodes by tag property without the tag will need to be updated to include the tag name.

Removed Insecure Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    The "insecure" option in cell.yaml has been removed.

Why make the change
    Insecure mode of operation was a vestigial option originally designed to aid in bootstrapping and setting up initial
    admin users.  Telepath now allows for ``cell://`` and ``unix://`` connection schemes that can bypass authentication
    for local users making insecure mode unnecessary.  Additionally, it is currently possible to bootstrap a root
    password directly using command line arguments, environment variables, or configuration files.

What you need to do
    If you have services deployed in insecure mode, they will need to be transitioned to using proper authentication.

Removed Default Values From Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    Model properties may no longer have default values.

Why make the change
    The root reason for this change is a complex cascade of requirements which hinge on the simple concept of populating
    a default value.  In Synapse ``0.2.x``, nodes may be created and edited without lifting them.  This means that
    ingest speeds can be significantly increased by taking an "upsert" approach.  However, it also has the side effect
    of making it very difficult to know if a given node already has a value specified in another layer without lifting
    and fusing the node from all the properties in all the layers within the view.  Ultimately, by removing the
    expectation of default values for a given property, we have been able to allow the Cortex to create nodes without
    needing to lift them, creating a large performance benefit.

What you need to do
    If you have custom model elements that have default values, they will no longer be populated by default.  As a work
    around, you may create a trigger which populates the property when the node is added, but use caution when merging
    properties from multiple layers when populating defaults.

Node Data Fields Must Be JSON Compatible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    Node properties of type ``data`` as well as untyped ``node data`` must be JSON serializable.

Why make the change
    Node properties of type ``data`` are stored using msgpack serialization, however many of our externally facing APIs
    use JSON serialization.  By adding the requirement that these fields are JSON compatible, we prevent issues which
    would preclude nodes from being returned via HTTP APIs.

What you need to do
    If you're using ``data`` fields or ``node data`` to store raw bytes or other data structures that are incompatible
    with JSON serialization, you will need to migrate these values to JSON compatible structures prior to running your
    ``0.2.0`` migration.

Storm Command Argument Passing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    The Storm command architecture has been updated to allow passing variables, properties, and tag values as parameters.
    As such, a couple commands have had parameters change to bring them in line with the new convention.

Why make the change
    This change allows dynamic resolution of command line arguments on a per-node basis and standardizes a mechanism
    for giving inputs to commands.  Several variants of similar behavior existed in one-off implementations and this
    change standardizes the various emerging patterns into a single supported design pattern.

What you need to do
    The following storm commands have changed:

    ========== ======================================== =============================== ======================================
    storm cmd  Description of the change                Old Use Example                 New Use Example
    ========== ======================================== =============================== ======================================
    movetags   No longer takes ``#`` prefixes on tags.  ``movetags #foo.bar #baz.faz``  ``movetags foo.bar baz.faz``
    min/max    No longer take full property names       ``min file:bytes:size``         ``min :size``
    scrape     Argument convention refactored.          ``scrape --props foo``          ``scrape :foo``
    ========== ======================================== =============================== ======================================

Centralized Cortex Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What changed
    Standing up a Cortex was previously configured with a pair of files, ``cell.yaml`` and ``boot.yaml``, in addition to
    command line arguments provided to to the server, ``synapse.servers.cortex``. The Cortex (and other Cell) startup
    configuration data has been centralized. The ``boot.yaml`` file has been removed, along with the ``auth:admin``
    value. ``auth:passwd`` has been added to the ``cell.yaml`` file that can be used to set the password for the
    ``root`` user. In addition, the command line server can be used to pass various configuration elements, and may
    also be used to pass configuration elements in via environment variables. Configuration structures are also schema
    validated, to prevent erroneous values from being set by users.

Why make the change
    This change reduced the overhead in managing and running a Cortex (and other Cells) by centralizing configuration to
    a single location, as well as supporting environment variables for all boot-time configuration options.

What you need to do
    The ``auth:admin`` value in any ``boot.yaml``, after splitting off the username, would need to be moved to a
    ``cell.yaml`` file.

    ::

        $cat boot.yaml
        ---
        auth:admin: root:superSekri7!
        ...

        # Updated into the new cell.yaml file
        $cat cell.yaml
        ---
        auth:passwd: superSekri7!
        ...

Additional Changes
------------------

- ``map_async`` is now enabled by default for all slabs.
- Synapse tools may not be used to connect to services of a different minor version.
- Storm API methods now support user-impersonation by providing a user iden in the ``opts`` dictionary. This ability is
  permission enforced.
- Deprecated annotations added to APIs that will be removed in ``0.3.0``.  This includes the Cortex ``.eval()`` API.
- The ``sudo`` command has been deprecated and does nothing.
- Removed cortex offset storage.
- SYNDEV_OMIT_FINI_WARNS was added to silence tear down warnings.
- Provenance is disabled by default. Enable by setting ``provenance:en: True`` in ``cell.yaml``.
- The CellApi ``@adminapi`` decorator now must be called as a function, ``@adminapi()``.
- The CellApi's used for managing users and roles have been updated to be iden oriented, as opposed to being name
  oriented. User and Role management APIs have also been exposed via Storm.
- The ``CoreApi.splices()`` method now takes a nodeedit offset tuple instead of an integer. It now yields a offset,
  splice tuple together instead of just splices.
