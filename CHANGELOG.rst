v2.2.0 - 2020-06-26
===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Add a ``postAnit()`` callback to the ``synapse.lib.base.Base()`` object which is called *after* the ``__anit__()``
  call chain is completed, but before ``Base.anit()`` returns the object instance to the caller. This is used by the
  Cell to defer certain Nexus actions until the Cell has completed initializing all of its instance attributes.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)
- Make ``synapse.lib.msgpack.en()`` raise a ``SynErr.NotMsgpackSafe`` exception instead of passing through the

  (`#1779 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1779>`_)
- Fix an Cell/Cortex startup issue which caused errors when starting up a Cortex when the last Nexus event was
  replayed. This has a secondary effect that Cell implementers cannot be making Nexus changes during the ``__anit__``
  methods.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add a minimal Storm Service example to the developer documentation.
