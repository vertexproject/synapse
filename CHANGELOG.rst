v2.9.0 - 2020-10-19
===================

Announcements
-------------

The ``v2.9.0`` Synapse release contains an automatic Cortex Layer data
migration. The updated layer storage format reduces disk and memory
requirements for a layer. It is recommended to test this process with a
backup of a Cortex before updating a production Cortex.

In order to maximize the space savings from the new layer storage format,
after the Cortex has been migrated to ``v2.9.0``, one can take a cold
backup of the Cortex and restore the Cortex from that backup. This
compacts the LMDB databases which back the Layers and reclaims disk space
as a result. This is an optional step; as LMDB will eventually re-use the
existing space on disk.

If there are any questions about this, please reach out in the Synapse Slack
channel so we can assist with any data migration questions.

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------
- Optimize the layer storage format for memory size and performance.
  (`#1877 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1877>`_)
  (`#1885 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1885>`_)
  (`#1899 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1899>`_)
  (`#1917 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1917>`_)
- Initial support Python 3.8 compatibility for the core Synapse library.
  Additional 3.8 support (such as wheels and Docker images) will be available
  in future releases.
  (`#1907 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1907>`_)
- Add a read only Storm option to the Storm runtime. This option prevents
  executing commands or Stormtypes functions which may modify data in the
  Cortex.
  (`#1869 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1869>`_)
  (`#1916 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1916>`_)
- Allow the Telepath Dmon to disconnect clients using a ready status.
  (`#1881 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1881>`_)
- Ensure that there is only one online backup of a Cell occurring at a time.
  (`#1883 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1883>`_)
- Added ``.lower()``, ``.strip()``, ``.lstrip()`` and ``.rstrip()`` methods
  to the Stormtypes Str object. These behave like the Python ``str`` methods.
  (`#1886 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1886>`_)
  (`#1906 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1906>`_)
- When scraping text, defanged indicators are now refanged by default.
  (`#1888 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1888>`_)
- Normalize read-only property declarations to use booleans in the data model.
  (`#1887 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1887>`_)
- Add ``lift.byverb`` command to allow lifting nodes using a light edge verb.
  (`#1890 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1890>`_)
- Add netblock and range lift helpers for ``inet:ipv6`` type, similar to the
  helpers for ``inet:ipv4``.
  (`#1869 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1869>`_)
- Add a ``edges.del`` command to bulk remove light weight edges from nodes.
  (`#1893 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1893>`_)
- The ``yield`` keyword in Storm now supports iterating over Stormtypes List
  and Set objects.
  (`#1898 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1898>`_)
- Add ``ou:contract``, ``ou:industry`` and ``it:reveng:function:strings``
  forms to the data model.
  (`#1894 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1894>`_)

- Add ``getFormCounts()`` API to the Stormtypes View and Layer objects.
  (`#1903 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1903>`_)
- Allow Cortex layers to report their total size on disk. This is exposed in
  the Stormtypes ``Layer.pack()`` method for a layer.
  (`#1910 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1910>`_)
- Expose the remote Storm Service name in the ``$lib.service.get()``
  Stormtypes API. This allows getting a service object without knowing
  the name of the service as it was locally added to a Cortex. Also add
  a ``$lib.service.has()`` API which allows checking to see if a service
  is available on a Cortex.
  (`#1908 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1908>`_)
  (`#1915 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1915>`_)

  comparators that can be used with logical expressions inside of Storm.
  (`#1906 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1906>`_)
- Promote ``CoreApi.addFeedData()`` calls to tracked tasks which can be
  viewed and terminated.
  (`#1918 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1918>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed a Storm bug where attempting to access an undeclared variable
  silently fails. This will now raise a ``NoSuchVar`` exception. This
  is verified at runtime, not at syntax evaluation.
  (`#1916 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1916>`_)
- Ensure that Storm HTTP APIs tear down the runtime task if the remote
  disconnects before consuming all of the messages.

  in greedy CPU use.
  (`#1902 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1902>`_)
- When pivoting across light edges, if the destination form was not a valid
  form, nothing happened. Now a StormRuntimeError is raised if the
  destination form is not valid.
  (`#1905 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1905>`_)
- Fix an issue with spawn processes accessing lmdb databases after a slab
  resize event has occurred by the main process.

  advertising identifiers, asnet6 and a few other secondary property additions.
  (`#1879 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1879>`_)
- Update the Cell backup APIs to perform a consistent backup across all slabs
  for a Cell.
  (`#1873 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1873>`_)
- Add support for a environment variable, ``SYN_LOCKMEM_DISABLE`` which will
  disable any memory locking of LMDB slabs.
  (`#1882 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1882>`_)

Deprecations
------------

- The ``0.1.x`` to ``2.x.x`` Migration tool and and associated Cortex sync
  service will be removed from Synapse in the ``2.9.0`` release. In order to
  move forward to ``2.9.0``, please make sure that any Cortexes which still
  need to be migrated will first be migrated to ``2.8.x`` prior to attempting
  to use ``2.9.x``.

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Add Synapse README content to the Pypi page. This was a community
  contribution from https://github.com/wesinator.  (`#1872
  <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1872>`_)


v2.7.3 - 2020-09-16
===================

Deprecations
------------
- The ``0.1.x`` to ``2.x.x`` Migration tool and and associated Cortex sync service will be removed from Synapse in
  the ``2.9.0`` release. In order to move forward to ``2.9.0``, please make sure that any Cortexes which still need to
  be migrated will first be migrated to ``2.8.x`` prior to attempting to use ``2.9.x``.
  (`#1880 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1880>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Remove duplicate words in a comment. This was a community contribution from enadjoe.
  (`#1874 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1874>`_)
- Fix a nested Nexus log event in Storm Service deletion. The ``del`` event causing Storm code execution could lead to
  nested Nexus events, which is incongruent with how Nexus change handlers work. This now spins off the Storm code in
  a free-running coroutine. This does change the service ``del`` semantics since any support Storm packages a service
  had may be removed by the time the handler executes.
  (`#1876 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1876>`_)
- Fix an issue where the ``cull`` parameter was not being passed to the multiqueue properly when calling ``.gets()``
  on a Storm Types Queue object.
  (`#1876 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1876>`_)
- Pin the ``nbconvert`` package to a known working version, as ``v6.0.0`` of that package broke the Synapse document
  generation by changing how templates work.
  (`#1876 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1876>`_)
- Correct ``min`` and ``max`` integer examples in tagprop documentation and tests.
  (`#1878 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1878>`_)


v2.7.2 - 2020-09-04
===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------
- Update tests for additional test code coverage. This was a community contribution from blackout.
  (`#1867 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1867>`_)
- Add implicit links to documentation generated for Storm services, to allow for direct linking inside of documentation
  to specific Storm commands.
  (`#1866 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1866>`_)
- Add future support for deprecating model elements in the Synapse data model. This support will produce client and
  server side warnings when deprecated model elements are used or loaded by custom model extensions or CoreModules.
  (`#1863 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1863>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Update ``FixedCache.put()`` to avoid a cache miss. This was a community contribution from blackout.
  (`#1868 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1868>`_)
- Fix the ioloop construction to be aware of ``SYN_GREEDY_CORO`` environment variable to put the ioloop into debug mode
  and log long-running coroutines.
  (`#1870 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1870>`_)
- Fix how service permissions are checked in ``$lib.service.get()`` and ``$lib.service.wait()`` Storm library calls.
  These APIs now first check ``service.get.<service iden>`` before checking ``service.get.<service name>`` permissions.
  A successful ``service.get.<service name>`` check will result in a warning to the client and the server.
  (`#1871 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1871>`_)

  (`#1786 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1786>`_)
- Fix rule indexing for the ``synapse.tools.cellauth`` tool to correctly print the rule offsets.
  (`#1787 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1787>`_)
- Remove extraneous output from the Storm Parser output.
  (`#1789 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1789>`_)
- Rewrite the language (and private APIs) for the Storm ``model.edge`` related commands to remove references to extended
  properties. That was confusing language which was unclear for users.
  (`#1789 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1789>`_)
- During 2.0.0 migrations, ensure that Cortex and Layer idens are unique; and make minimum 0.1.6 version requirement for
  migration.
  (`#1788 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1788>`_)


v2.2.1 - 2020-06-30
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- The Axon test suite was missing a test for calling ``Axon.get()`` on a file it did not have. This is now included in
  the test suite.
  (`#1783 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1783>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Improve Synapse devops documentation hierarchy. Add note about Cell directories being persistent.
  (`#1781 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1781>`_)


v2.2.0 - 2020-06-26
===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Add a ``postAnit()`` callback to the ``synapse.lib.base.Base()`` object which is called *after* the ``__anit__()``
  call chain is completed, but before ``Base.anit()`` returns the object instance to the caller. This is used by the
  Cell to defer certain Nexus actions until the Cell has completed initializing all of its instance attributes.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)
- Make ``synapse.lib.msgpack.en()`` raise a ``SynErr.NotMsgpackSafe`` exception instead of passing through the
  exception raised by msgpack.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)

Bugfixes
--------

- Add a missing ``toprim()`` call in ``$lib.globals.set()``.
  (`#1778 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1778>`_)
- Fix an issue in the quickstart documentation related to permissions. Thank you ``enadjoe`` for your contribution.
  (`#1779 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1779>`_)
- Fix an Cell/Cortex startup issue which caused errors when starting up a Cortex when the last Nexus event was
  replayed. This has a secondary effect that Cell implementers cannot be making Nexus changes during the ``__anit__``
  methods.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add a minimal Storm Service example to the developer documentation.
  (`#1776 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1776>`_)
- Reorganize the Synapse User Guide into a more hierarchical format.
  (`#1777 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1777>`_)

===================

Bugfixes
--------
