Synapse Changelog
*****************

v2.167.0 - 2024-04-19
=====================

Automatic Migrations
--------------------
- Set the ``protected`` flag on all Views in the Cortex, using the existing
  value of the ``nomerge`` flag.
  (`#3681 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3681>`_)
- See :ref:`datamigration` for more information about automatic migrations.

Model Changes
-------------
- Updates to the ``base`` and ``file`` models.
  (`#3674 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3674>`_)
  (`#3688 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3688>`_)

  **Updated Types**

  ``file:path``
    Normalizing paths such as ``../.././..`` previously failed. This now
    produces an empty path.

  **Deprecated Types**

  The following types have been marked as deprecated:

  * ``edge``
  * ``timeedge``

  **Deprecated Forms**

  The following forms have been marked as deprecated:

  * ``graph:cluster``
  * ``graph:node``
  * ``graph:event``
  * ``edge:refs``
  * ``edge:has``
  * ``edge:wentto``
  * ``graph:edge``
  * ``graph:timeedge``

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------
- Add ``aha.svc.list`` and ``aha.svc.stat`` commands to enumerate the AHA
  services. Add ``$lib.aha`` Storm APIs to delete, get, and list the AHA
  services.
  (`#3685 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3685>`_)
  (`#3692 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3692>`_)
  (`#3693 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3693>`_)

  (`#3681 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3681>`_)
- Update the ``StormPkgTest.getTestCore()`` API to add a ``prepkghook``
  callback option. This can be used to execute code prior to loading Storm
  packages. The ``getTestCore()`` API now waits for ``onload`` handlers to
  complete for each package it loads.
  (`#3687 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3687>`_)
- Ensure that the ``Cell.ahaclient`` is fully owned and managed by the

  for forking a view. This permission defaults to being allowed.
  (`#3437 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3437>`_)
- Add Storm operators to allow pivoting and joining across light edges. The
  following examples show pivoting across ``refs`` edges and joining the
  destination nodes with the inbound nodes: ``-(refs)+>`` and ``<+(refs)-``.
  (`#3441 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3441>`_)
- Add Storm operators to do pivot out and join ( ``--+>`` ) and pivot in
  and join ( ``<+--``) operations across light edges.

Bugfixes
--------
- Prevent recursion errors in ``inet:fqdn`` onset handlers.
  (`#3433 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3433>`_)
- When dereferencing a list or dictionary object off of a Node in Storm, the
  returned value is now a copy of the value. This avoids the situation where
  modifying the deferenced value appeared to alter the node but did not
  actually result in any edits to the underlying data.
  (`#3439 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3439>`_)
- Add a missing sub-query example to Storm ``for`` loop documentation.

Deprecations
------------
- Deprecated Cortex and splice related APIs which were marked for removal
  after 2023-10-01 have been removed. The list of these APIs can be found
  at  :ref:`changelog-depr-20231001`. These additional splice related changes
  have also been made:

    The HTTP API ``/api/v1/storm`` now sets the default ``editformat`` opt
    value to ``nodeedits``. Previously this API produced splice changes by
    default.

    The ``synapse.tools.cmdr`` ``storm`` command no longer displays splices.

    The ``synapse.tools.cmdr`` ``log`` command no longer records splices.

    The ``synapse.tools.csvtool`` tool no longer records or displays splices.

    The ``synapse.tools.feed`` tool no longer supports splices or nodeedits as
    input and the splice documentation example has been removed.

  (`#3449 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3449>`_)
- The deprecated function ``synapse.common.aclosing()`` has been removed.
  (`#3449 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3449>`_)
- Provisioning a Synapse service with AHA now always updates the local CA
  certificate and generates new host and user certificates for the service.
  Previously these would not be regenerated if the CA or service names did
  not change.

- Update ``Cell.getLogExtra()`` to prefer using the ``user`` key from the task
  scope before using the ``sess`` key from the task scope. Cortex APIs which
  execute Storm queries now set the ``user`` scope to the user the query is
  running as. This increases the accuracy of log events caused by Storm
  queries when the ``user`` is specified in the ``opts``.
  (`#3356 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3356>`_)

  (`#3328 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3328>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Stormtypes ``stor`` functions were not previously checked during
  ``readonly`` runtime execution. These are now validated and ``stor``
  functions which would result in changing data in the Cortex will now

  (`#3215 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3215>`_)
- Fix an issue with the Cell backup space checks. They now properly calculate
  the amount of free space when the Cell backup directory is configured
  on a separate volume from the Cell storage directory.
  (`#3216 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3216>`_)
- Prevent the ``yield`` operator from directly emitting nodes into the Storm
  pipeline if those node objects came from a different view. Nodes previously
  lifted in this manner must be lifted by calling the ``iden()`` function on
  the object to ensure the node being lifted into the pipeline reflects the
  current view.
  (`#3218 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3218>`_)
- Always remove the ``mirror`` configuration option from ``cell.mods.yaml``
  when provisioning a service via Aha. The previous behavior prevented the
  correct restoration of a service from a backup which had been changed from
  being a leader to being a mirror.
  (`#3220 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3220>`_)

v2.140.1 - 2023-06-30

  expressions and raise a ``StormRuntimeError``.
  (`#3203 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3203>`_)
- Fix a bug where ``synapse.lib.platforms.linux.getTotalMemory()`` did not
  return the correct value in a process running in cgroupsv1 without a
  maximum memory limit set.
  (`#3198 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3198>`_)
- Fix a bug where a Cron job could be created with an invalid Storm query.
  Cron jobs now have their queries parsed as part of creation to ensure that
  they are valid Storm. ``$lib.cron`` APIs now accept heavy Storm query
  objects as query inputs.
  (`#3201 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3201>`_)
  (`#3207 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3207>`_)
- Field data sent via Storm ``$lib.inet.http`` APIs that uses a multipart
  upload without a valid ``name`` field now raises a ``BadArg`` error.

  (`#3191 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/issue/3191>`_)

v2.139.0 - 2023-06-16
=====================

Announcement
------------

Due to the introduction of several powerful new APIs and performance
improvements, Synapse will be updating to *only* support Python >=3.11.
Our current plan is to drop support for Python <=3.10 in ~4 weeks on
2023-06-19. The next release after 2023-06-19 will include changes that
are not backward compatible to earlier versions of Python.

If you currently deploy Synapse Open-Source or Synapse Enterprise via
the standard docker containers, you will be unaffected.  If you install
Synapse via PyPI, you will need to ensure that your environment is
updated to Python 3.11+.

  ``synapse.telepath.aha_clients`` dictionary. This isolates the Cell
  connection to Aha from other clients.
  (`#3008 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3008>`_)
- When the Cell mirror loop exits, it now reports the current ``ready`` status
  to the Aha service. This allows a service to mark itself as "not ready" when
  the loop restarts and it is a follower, since it may no longer be in the
  realtime change window.

  assigning a property value through ``$node.props``. 
  (`#3098 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3098>`_)
- Fix an issue where the Cell would report a static ``ready`` value to the Aha
  service upon reconnecting, instead of the current ``ready`` status. The
  ``Cell.ahainfo`` value was replaced with a ``Cell.getAhaInfo()`` API which
  returns the current information to report to the Aha service.

  the base Cell.
  (`#2998 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2998>`_)
  (`#3004 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3004>`_)
- Clarify the error message encountered by a Synapse mirrored service if
  the mirror gets desynchronized from its upstream service.
  (`#3006 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3006>`_)
- Update how read-only properties are handled during merges. The ``.created``
  property will always be set when merging a node down. If two nodes have
  other conflicting read-only property values, those will now emit a warning
  in the Storm runtime.
  (`#2989 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2989>`_)
- The ``Axon.wget()`` API response now includes HTTP request history, which is
  added when the API request encounters redirects. The ``$lib.axon.wget()``
  Storm API now includes information about the original request URL. This data
  is now used to create ``inet:urlredir`` nodes, such as when the Storm
  ``wget`` command is used to retrieve a file.
  (`#3011 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3011>`_)
- Ensure that ``BadTypeValu`` exceptions raised when normalizing invalid
  data with the ``time`` type includes the value in the exception message.
  (`#3009 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3009>`_)

  a relative property or variable to operate on rather than node iden.
  (`#3018 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3018>`_)
- Synapse HTTP API logs now include the user iden and username when that
  information is available. For deployments with structured logging enabled,
  the HTTP path, HTTP status code, user iden, and username are added to
  that log message.
  (`#3007 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3007>`_)
- Add ``web_useriden`` and ``web_username`` attributes to the Synapse HTTP
  Handler class. These are used for HTTP request logging to populate
  the user iden and username data. These are automatically set when a user
  authenticates using a session token or via basic authentication.
  The HTTP Session tracking now tracks the username at the time the session
  was created. The ``_web_user`` value, which previously pointed to a heavy
  HiveUser object, is no longer populated by default.
  (`#3007 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3007>`_)
- Add ``$lib.inet.http.codereason`` Storm API for translating HTTP status
  codes to reason phrases. ``inet:http:resp`` objects now also have a
  ``reason`` value populated.
  (`#3023 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3023>`_)
- Update the minimum version of the ``cryptography`` library to ``39.0.1`` and
  the minimum version of the ``pyopenssl`` library to ``23.0.0``.
  (`#3022 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3022>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- The Storm ``wget`` command created ``inet:urlfile`` nodes with the ``url``
  property of the resolved URL from ``aiohttp``. This made it so that a user
  could not pivot from an ``inet:url`` node which had a URL encoded parameter
  string to the resulting ``inet:urlfile`` node. The ``inet:urlfile`` nodes
  are now made with the original request URL to allow that pivoting to occur.
  (`#3011 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3011>`_)
- The ``Axon.wget()`` and ``$lib.axon.wget()`` APIs returned URLs in the
  ``url`` field of their responses which did not contain fragment identifiers.
  These API responses now include the fragment identifier if it was present in
  the resolved URL.
  (`#3011 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3011>`_)
- The Storm ``tree`` command did not properly handle Storm query arguments
  which were declared as ``storm:query`` types.
  (`#3012 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3012>`_)
- Remove an unnecessary permission check in the Storm ``movenodes`` command
  which could cause the command to fail.
  (`#3002 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3002>`_)
- When a user email address was provided to the HTTP API
  ``/api/v1/auth/adduser``, the handler did not properly set the email using
  change controlled APIs, so that information would not be sent to mirrored
  cells. The email is now being set properly.
  (`#2998 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2998>`_)
- The ``risk:vuln:cvss:av`` enum incorrectly included ``V`` instead of ``P``.
  (`#3013 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3013>`_)
- Fix an issue where the ``ismax`` specification on time types did not merge
  time values correctly.
  (`#3017 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3017>`_)
- Fix an issue where using a function call to specify the tag in a tagprop
  operation would not be correctly parsed.
  (`#3020 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3020>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Update copyright notice to always include the current year.
  (`#3010 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3010>`_)

Deprecations
------------
- The ``synapse.lib.httpapi.Handler.user()`` and
  ``synapse.lib.httpapi.Handler.getUserBody()`` methods are marked as
  deprecated. These methods will be removed in Synapse ``v2.130.0``.

  versions of ``aiostmplib`` and ``aiohttp-socks`` to their latest versions.
  (`#2986 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2986>`_)
- The ``X-XSS-Protection`` header was removed from the default HTTP API
  handlers. This header is non-standard and only supported by Safari browsers.
  Service deployments which rely on this header should use the
  ``https:headers`` configuration option to inject that header into their
  HTTP responses.
  (`#2997 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2997>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Malformed hash values normalized as ``file:bytes`` raised exceptions which
  were not properly caught, causing Storm ``?=`` syntax to fail. Malformed
  values are now properly handled in ``file:bytes``.
  (`#3000 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/3000>`_)

  removed.
  (`#2995 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2995>`_)

v2.121.1 - 2022-01-23
=====================

Bugfixes
--------
- When creating Storm Macros using ``v2.121.0``, the creator of the Macro was
  incorrectly set to the ``root`` user. This is now set to the user that
  created the macro using the Storm ``macro.set`` command or the
  ``$lib.macro.set()`` API.
  (`#2993 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2993>`_)

v2.121.0 - 2022-01-20

    removed from them.

  ``ou:org``
    Add a ``goals`` property to record the assessed goals of the organization.

- Add extended permissions for Storm Macro functionality using a new
  simplified permissions system. This allows users to opt into assigning
  users or roles the permission to read, write, administrate, or deny access
  to their Macros. These permissions can be set by the Storm
  ``$lib.macro.grant()`` API.
  (`#2973 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2973>`_)
- Add extended information about a Storm Macro, including its creation time,
  update time, and a description. The Macro name, description and Storm can
  now be set via the Storm ``$lib.macro.mod()`` API.
  (`#2973 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2973>`_)
- Allow users and Power-Ups to store graph projection definitions in the
  Cortex. Graph projections have the same simplified permissions system
  applied to them as introduced for Storm Macros. Storm users can now also
  load a stored graph projection into a running Storm query. These new
  features are exposed via the Storm ``$lib.graph`` APIs.
  (`#2914 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2914>`_)
- The disk space required to make the backup of a Synapse service is now
  checked prior to a live backup being made. If there is insufficient storage
  to make the backup on the volume storing the backup, a LowSpace exception
  will be raised.
  (`#2990 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2990>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- When normalizing the ``inet:email`` type, an unclear Python ``ValueError``
  could have been raised to a user. This is now caught and a specific
  ``BadTypeValu`` exception is raised.
  (`#2982 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2982>`_)
- The ``synapse.exc.StormRaise`` exception caused an error when recreating
  the exception on the client side of a Telepath connection. This exception
  will now raise properly on the caller side.
  (`#2985 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2985>`_)
- When using the Storm ``diff`` command to examine a forked View, if a node
  was deleted out from the base layer and edited in the fork, an exception
  would be raised. This situation is now properly handled.
  (`#2988 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2988>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Update the Storm User Guide section on variables for clarity.

    describes the target IP address.

- Add a new Cell configuration option, ``limit:disk:free``. This represents
  the minimum percentage of free disk space on the volume hosting a Synapse
  service that is required in order to start up. This value is also
  monitored every minute and will disable the Cell Nexus if the free space
  drops below the specified value. This value defaults to five percent
  ( ``5 %`` ) free disk space.
  (`#2920 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2920>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Add a Devops task related to configuration of the free space requirement.

  (`#2935 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2935>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- When a Storm Dmon definition lacked a ``view`` iden, it would previously
  default to using the Cortex default view. Dmons now prefer to use the user
  default view before using the Cortex default view. This situation would only

  (`#2883 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2883>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Move the Nexus ``runMirrorLoop`` task to hang off of the Telepath Proxy
  and not the Telepath client. This results in a faster teardown of the
  ``runMirrorLoop`` task during Nexus shutdown.
  (`#2878 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2878>`_)
- Remove duplicate tokens presented to users in Storm syntax errors.
  (`#2879 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2879>`_)
- When bootstrapping a service mirror with Aha provisioning, the ``prov.done``
  file that was left in the service storage directory was the value from the
  upstream service, and not the service that has been provisioned. This
  resulted in ``NoSuchName`` exceptions when restarting mirrors.
  The bootstrapping process now records the correct value in the ``prov.done``
  file.
  (`#2882 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2882>`_)

  (`#2871 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2871>`_)
- Add Nexus support for HTTP API sessions.
  (`#2869 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2869>`_)
- Add support for runtime string formatting in Storm. This is done with
  backtick ( `````) encapsulated strings.
  An example of this is ``$world='world' $lib.print(`hello {$world}`)``
  (`#2870 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2870>`_)
  (`#2875 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2875>`_)

  be used to get realtime changes about services, such as user creation or
  modification events; or layer and view change events in the Cortex.
  (`#2851 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2851>`_)
- Update stored user password hashing to use PBKDF2. Passwords are migrated
  to this format as successful user logins are performed.
  (`#2868 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2868>`_)
- Add the ability to restore a backup tarball from a URL to the Cell startup
  process. When a Cell starts via ``initFromArgv()``, if the environment
  variable ``SYN_RESTORE_HTTPS_URL`` is present, that value will be used to
  retrieve a tarball via HTTPS and extract it to the service local storage,
  removing any existing data in the directory. This is done prior to any
  Aha based provisioning.
  (`#2859 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2859>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- The embedded Axon inside of a Cortex (used when the ``axon`` config option

  (`#2757 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/2757>`_)

  ``about``
    A light edge created by the Storm ``note.add`` command, which records
    the relationship between a ``meta:note`` node and the target node.

  ``includes``
    When used with a ``ou:contribution`` node, the edge indicates the target
    node was the contribution made.

    When used with a ``meta:ruleset`` and ``meta:rule`` node, indicates
    the ruleset contains the rule.

  ``matches``
    When used with a ``meta:rule`` node, the edge indicates the target
    node matches the rule.

  ``refs``
    A light edge where the source node refers to the target node.

  ``seenat``
    When used with a ``geo:telem`` target node, the edge indicates the source
    node was seen a given location.

  ``uses``
    When used with a ``ou:org`` node, the edge indicates the target node
    is used by the organization.

This release contains an automatic data migration that may cause additional
startup time on the first boot. This is done to unique array properties which
previously were not uniqued. Deployments with startup or liveliness probes
should have those disabled while this upgrade is performed to prevent
accidental termination of the Cortex process. Please ensure you have a tested
backup available before applying this update.

  when their logical condition is first met. This means that subsequent
  clauses in those statements may not be executed.
  (`#1952 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1952>`_)
- Add a mechanism for Storm Services to specify commands which may require
  privilege elevation to execute. An example of this may be to allow a command
  to create nodes; without managning individual permissions on what nodes a
  user may normally be allowed to create. Services using this mechanism wiill
  use the ``storm.asroot.cmd.<<cmd name>>`` hierarchy to grant this permission.

  (`#1946 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1946>`_)
- Update the ``ou`` model to add ``ou:attendee`` and ``ou:contest`` and
  ``ou:contest:result`` forms. Several secondary properties related to
  conference attendance have been marked deprecated.
  (`#1946 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1946>`_)
- The ``ps:persona`` and ``ps:persona:has`` forms have been marked as
  deprecated.

- Add ``ps:contactlist`` to allow collecting multiple ``ps:contact`` nodes
  together.
  (`#1935 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1935>`_)

  (`#1924 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1924>`_)


v2.9.0 - 2020-10-19
===================

Announcements
-------------

The ``v2.9.0`` Synapse release contains an automatic Cortex Layer data
migration. The updated layer storage format reduces disk and memory
requirements for a layer. It is recommended to test this process with a
backup of a Cortex before updating a production Cortex.

In order to maximize the space savings from the new layer storage format,
after the Cortex has been migrated to ``v2.9.0``, one can take a cold
backup of the Cortex and restore the Cortex from that backup. This
compacts the LMDB databases which back the Layers and reclaims disk space
as a result. This is an optional step; as LMDB will eventually re-use the
existing space on disk.

If there are any questions about this, please reach out in the Synapse Slack
channel so we can assist with any data migration questions.

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------
- Optimize the layer storage format for memory size and performance.
  (`#1877 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1877>`_)

  Additional 3.8 support (such as wheels and Docker images) will be available
  in future releases.
  (`#1907 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1907>`_)
- Add a read only Storm option to the Storm runtime. This option prevents
  executing commands or Stormtypes functions which may modify data in the
  Cortex.
  (`#1869 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1869>`_)
  (`#1916 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1916>`_)

  (`#1881 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1881>`_)
- Ensure that there is only one online backup of a Cell occurring at a time.
  (`#1883 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1883>`_)
- Added ``.lower()``, ``.strip()``, ``.lstrip()`` and ``.rstrip()`` methods
  to the Stormtypes Str object. These behave like the Python ``str`` methods.
  (`#1886 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1886>`_)
  (`#1906 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1906>`_)
- When scraping text, defanged indicators are now refanged by default.
  (`#1888 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1888>`_)

  helpers for ``inet:ipv4``.
  (`#1869 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1869>`_)
- Add a ``edges.del`` command to bulk remove light weight edges from nodes.
  (`#1893 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1893>`_)

  the Stormtypes ``Layer.pack()`` method for a layer.
  (`#1910 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1910>`_)
- Expose the remote Storm Service name in the ``$lib.service.get()``
  Stormtypes API. This allows getting a service object without knowing
  the name of the service as it was locally added to a Cortex. Also add
  a ``$lib.service.has()`` API which allows checking to see if a service
  is available on a Cortex.
  (`#1908 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1908>`_)
  (`#1915 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1915>`_)

- Promote ``CoreApi.addFeedData()`` calls to tracked tasks which can be
  viewed and terminated.
  (`#1918 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1918>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed a Storm bug where attempting to access an undeclared variable
  silently fails. This will now raise a ``NoSuchVar`` exception. This
  is verified at runtime, not at syntax evaluation.
  (`#1916 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1916>`_)
- Ensure that Storm HTTP APIs tear down the runtime task if the remote
  disconnects before consuming all of the messages.

  disable any memory locking of LMDB slabs.
  (`#1882 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1882>`_)

Deprecations
------------

- The ``0.1.x`` to ``2.x.x`` Migration tool and and associated Cortex sync
  service will be removed from Synapse in the ``2.9.0`` release. In order to
  move forward to ``2.9.0``, please make sure that any Cortexes which still
  need to be migrated will first be migrated to ``2.8.x`` prior to attempting
  to use ``2.9.x``.

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Add Synapse README content to the Pypi page. This was a community
  contribution from https://github.com/wesinator.  (`#1872
  <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1872>`_)


v2.7.3 - 2020-09-16
===================

Deprecations
------------
- The ``0.1.x`` to ``2.x.x`` Migration tool and and associated Cortex sync service will be removed from Synapse in
  the ``2.9.0`` release. In order to move forward to ``2.9.0``, please make sure that any Cortexes which still need to
  be migrated will first be migrated to ``2.8.x`` prior to attempting to use ``2.9.x``.
  (`#1880 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1880>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Remove duplicate words in a comment. This was a community contribution from enadjoe.
  (`#1874 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1874>`_)
- Fix a nested Nexus log event in Storm Service deletion. The ``del`` event causing Storm code execution could lead to
  nested Nexus events, which is incongruent with how Nexus change handlers work. This now spins off the Storm code in
  a free-running coroutine. This does change the service ``del`` semantics since any support Storm packages a service
  had may be removed by the time the handler executes.
  (`#1876 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1876>`_)
- Fix an issue where the ``cull`` parameter was not being passed to the multiqueue properly when calling ``.gets()``
  on a Storm Types Queue object.
  (`#1876 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1876>`_)
- Pin the ``nbconvert`` package to a known working version, as ``v6.0.0`` of that package broke the Synapse document
  generation by changing how templates work.

  to specific Storm commands.
  (`#1866 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1866>`_)
- Add future support for deprecating model elements in the Synapse data model. This support will produce client and
  server side warnings when deprecated model elements are used or loaded by custom model extensions or CoreModules.
  (`#1863 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1863>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Update ``FixedCache.put()`` to avoid a cache miss. This was a community contribution from blackout.
  (`#1868 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1868>`_)
- Fix the ioloop construction to be aware of ``SYN_GREEDY_CORO`` environment variable to put the ioloop into debug mode
  and log long-running coroutines.
  (`#1870 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1870>`_)
- Fix how service permissions are checked in ``$lib.service.get()`` and ``$lib.service.wait()`` Storm library calls.
  These APIs now first check ``service.get.<service iden>`` before checking ``service.get.<service name>`` permissions.
  A successful ``service.get.<service name>`` check will result in a warning to the client and the server.
  (`#1871 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1871>`_)

  trying to open files in the directory.
  (`#1860 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/issues/1860>`_)
  (`#1861 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1861>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

  the ``syn:cmd`` runt nodes.
  (`#1850 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1850>`_)
- Add package level configuration data to Storm Packages in the ``modconf`` value of a package definition. This is added
