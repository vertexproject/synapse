===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Add a ``postAnit()`` callback to the ``synapse.lib.base.Base()`` object which is called *after* the ``__anit__()``

  Cell to defer certain Nexus actions until the Cell has completed initializing all of its instance attributes.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)

  (`#1779 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1779>`_)

  replayed. This has a secondary effect that Cell implementers cannot be making Nexus changes during the ``__anit__``
  methods.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add a minimal Storm Service example to the developer documentation.
