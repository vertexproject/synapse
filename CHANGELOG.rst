===================

Features and Enhancements

  (`#1782 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1782>`_)
- Add an ``autoadd`` mode to Storm, which will extract basic indicators and make nodes from them when executed. This is
  a superset of the behavior in the ``lookup`` mode.
  (`#1795 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1795>`_)
- Support skipping directories in the ``synapse.tools.backup`` tool.

  edges.

- Add additional terms to the Synapse glossary.
  (`#1784 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1784>`_)

v2.2.2 - 2020-07-03
===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Add some small enhancements to the Cortex benchmarking script.
  (`#1790 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1790>`_)

  (`#1786 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1786>`_)
- Fix rule indexing for the ``synapse.tools.cellauth`` tool to correctly print the rule offsets.
  (`#1787 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1787>`_)

  (`#1789 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1789>`_)
- Rewrite the language (and private APIs) for the Storm ``model.edge`` related commands to remove references to extended
  properties. That was confusing language which was unclear for users.
  (`#1789 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1789>`_)
- During 2.0.0 migrations, ensure that Cortex and Layer idens are unique; and make minimum 0.1.6 version requirement for
  migration.
  (`#1788 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1788>`_)


v2.2.1 - 2020-06-30
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- The Axon test suite was missing a test for calling ``Axon.get()`` on a file it did not have. This is now included in
  the test suite.
  (`#1783 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1783>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Improve Synapse devops documentation hierarchy. Add note about Cell directories being persistent.
  (`#1781 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1781>`_)


v2.2.0 - 2020-06-26
===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Add a ``postAnit()`` callback to the ``synapse.lib.base.Base()`` object which is called *after* the ``__anit__()``
  call chain is completed, but before ``Base.anit()`` returns the object instance to the caller. This is used by the
  Cell to defer certain Nexus actions until the Cell has completed initializing all of its instance attributes.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)
- Make ``synapse.lib.msgpack.en()`` raise a ``SynErr.NotMsgpackSafe`` exception instead of passing through the
  exception raised by msgpack.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)

Bugfixes
--------

- Add a missing ``toprim()`` call in ``$lib.globals.set()``.
  (`#1778 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1778>`_)
- Fix an issue in the quickstart documentation related to permissions. Thank you ``enadjoe`` for your contribution.
  (`#1779 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1779>`_)
- Fix an Cell/Cortex startup issue which caused errors when starting up a Cortex when the last Nexus event was
  replayed. This has a secondary effect that Cell implementers cannot be making Nexus changes during the ``__anit__``
  methods.
  (`#1768 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1768>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add a minimal Storm Service example to the developer documentation.
  (`#1776 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1776>`_)
- Reorganize the Synapse User Guide into a more hierarchical format.
  (`#1777 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1777>`_)
