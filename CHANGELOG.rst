Synapse Changelog
*****************


v0.1.42 - 2019-12-24
====================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------
- Allow for StormType ``query`` objects to be executed similar to a local function.
  (`#1456 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1456>`_)
- Add ``syn:cmd`` runt nodes to represent Storm commands available to a given Cortex as Nodes.
  (`#1446 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1446>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Make CI tests do eager updates of third party libraries to prevent cache key rolling when a buggy library is published
  and a subsequent fix is released.
  (`#1468 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1468>`_)
- Fix implicit pivot support for runt nodes.
  (`#1470 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1470>`_)
- Allow the Storm ``tee`` command to execute queries if there were no inbound nodes.
  (`#1468 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1468>`_)
- Allow the PropPivotOut AST node to pivot from an array value to a runt node.
  (`#1471 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1471>`_)
- Add some ``asyncio.sleep(0)`` calls to the AST where Python loops could hog CPU time.
  (`#1472 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1472>`_)
- Fix an issue with the Storm ``scrape`` command where a non-str repr was not properly scraped.
  (`#1474 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1474>`_)
- Fix an issue with the Storm ``scrape`` command where a relative property was not accepted as an argument to the
  command. Relative property syntax is now supported.
  (`#1474 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1474>`_)


v0.1.41 - 2019-12-16
====================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------
- Allow Storm expression syntax to handle None values gracefully for comparison purposes.
  (`#1459 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1459>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix a bug where removal of a tagprop didn't update the Node object in memory.
  (`#1454 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1454>`_)
- Speed up unit test execution by adding an additional Storm parsing cache.
  (`#1455 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1455>`_)
- Bump CircleCI cache keys due to a bad multidict release poisoning build caches.
  (`#1463 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1463>`_)
- Added an empty layer migration to prevent Cortex downgrading prior to v0.1.41. This is to prevent a user from running
  a Cortex on older code, as reverting a Cortex created/used with a Synapse version greater than or equal to v0.1.33 and
  v0.1.34, to a version prior than those, can result in apparent data loss. Data is not actually lost but would require
  non-trivial effort to recover.
  (`#1458 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1458>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Fix a broken link. Thank you aaronst for the bug report.
  (`#1448 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1448>`_)

- Fix permissions checks for Storm queue objects being made by non-object owners.
  (`#1452 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1452>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Some small wordsmithing.
  (`#1449 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1449>`_)


v0.1.39 - 2019-12-03
====================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Group Storm commands which came from Storm packages together when the ``storm help`` command is issued.
  (`#1440 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1440>`_)
- Add the secondary property ``:url`` to the ``ou:conference`` form to track ``inet:url`` nodes associated with a
  conference.
  (`#1441 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1441>`_)
- Add ``:names`` as a secondary property to ``ou:org`` to allow tracking multiple, secondary names for an organization.
  (`#1444 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1444>`_)
- The StormType ``$lib.ingest.feed()`` now places the runtime Snap into less-strict mode during execution to prevent
  potentially data causing the Storm runtime to be torn down. Errors during node creation or property sets will now
  cause ``warn`` messages to be emitted in the message stream.
  (`#1442 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1442>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix an issue where Storm command names were truncated when the ``storm help`` command was issued.

- Fix the CryoApi and CryoCell ``delete()`` APIs used to remove a Cryotank from a CryoCell.
  (`#1443 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1443>`_)
- Make NoSuchName errors in StormTypes more friendly by always including the missing name.
  (`#1445 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1445>`_)
- When deferencing a value off of a StormType, if a NoSuchName was thrown it was unclear what type of object was being
  deferenced, which could lead to difficult to debug Storm code.  The NoSuchName errors now includes the class name
  of the object to assist with debugging those errors.
  (`#1445 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1445>`_)


v0.1.38 - 2019-11-22
====================

- Add ``:loc`` secondary property to ``mat:item``, ``it:host``, and ``geo:nloc`` forms.
  (`#1437 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1437>`_)
- Split a Storm Daemon task into two components; a ``storm:dmon:main`` and ``storm:dmon:loop`` task. Killing the
  ``storm:dmon:loop`` task will cause the ``storm:dmon:main`` task to respawn the inner task executing Storm.
  (`#1436 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1436>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix a bug where a Storm Daemon coroutine was promoted to a Synapse Task with an incorrect user value.
  (`#1435 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1435>`_)
- Fix a Storm Runtime variable scoping issue preventing Storm functions from calling other Storm functions in the same
  scope they are declared in.
  (`#1435 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1435>`_)
- Fix an bug producing an ambiguity in the Storm ``switch`` case statement.  This bugfix does require switch case
  statements with a space in them to be enclosed in single or double quotes.
  (`#1438 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1438>`_)

- Add user defined functions to Storm.
  (`#1419 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1419>`_)
- Add packages to Storm, which may define importable command blocks or pure Storm commands.  Storm services no longer
  deliver commands via a separate data structure and must deliver then via Storm packages.
  (`#1419 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1419>`_)
  (`#1430 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1430>`_)

- Add a ``geo:bbox`` type to the datamodel to record a rectangular latitude and longitude bounding box, and a ``:bbox``
  secondary property to ``geo:place`` nodes.
  (`#1416 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1416>`_)
- Add ``init`` and ``fini`` Storm blocks, which can contain Storm which is executed **before** and **after** any nodes
  would have been consumed.
  (`#1418 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1418>`_)
- Add ``$lib.stats.tally()`` to Storm Types. This gets a ``Tally`` object that can currently be used to increment named

  (`#1402 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1402>`_)
- Allow objects (Views and Layers) to enforce permissions on themselves, as opposed to globally on a Cortex.
  (`#1384 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1384>`_)
- Harmonized methods which take permissions - some took a tuple, some took `*path` arguments. Now, all methods take a
  tuple for permissions.
  (`#1384 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1384>`_)
- Add support for the ``yield`` keyword in Storm to allow it to yield values which come from a binary buid, a Node iden,
  a raw Node object; or a an (async) generator which produces the previous values. This allows ``$lib.*`` functions to

  function.  These will be serialied with the ``synapse.tools.csvtool`` as zero length strings.
  (`#1413 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1413>`_)
- Allow ``synapse.tools.cellauth`` to work with older Synapse Cells which do not support the auth apis introduced

--------
- Fix a Daemon issue where Link message coroutines were being scheduled on the Daemon, and not the Link object.  This
  was preventing the proper cleanup of ``_onTaskV2Init`` coroutines for async generators when they were waiting for the
  next item and the link had been fini'd.  Now, when a Link is fini'd, any free-running coroutines associated with
  the a given Link will be cancelled.
  (`#1404 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1404>`_)

-------------------------
- Add ``:serial``, ``:model``, and ``:manu`` secondary properties to the ``it:host`` form.
  (`#1358 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1358>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fix an issue in Storm where double quoted string values with backslash escaped characters in double quoted strings
  were not being properly escaped during syntax parsing.  Double quoted strings are now being processed with
  ``ast.literal_eval()``.  This means that double quoted string values will be processed according to Python's
  string literals as seen here https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals prior
  to passing them into any sort of model normalization routines. Single quoted string values parsing is not affected by

v0.1.3 - 2019-04-17
===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Add the ability to delete a role via HTTP API, as well as being able to mark a user as being archived. Archiving a user will also lock a user. (`#1205 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1205>`_)
- Add support to archiving for user to the CellApi for use via Telepath. (`#1206 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1206>`_)

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix remote layer bug injected by previous optimization that would result in missing nodes from lifts when the node
  only resides in the distant layer. (`#1203 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1203>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Fix error in the HTTP API documentation. (`#1204 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1204>`_)


v0.1.2 - 2019-04-10
===================

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

- Automatically run unit tests for the master every day. (`#1192 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1192>`_)
- Add test suite for ``synapse.lib.urlhelp``. (`#1195 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1195>`_)
- Improve multi-layer and single layer performance. This is a backwards-incompatible API change in that 0.1.2 cortex
  will not interoperate with 0.1.2 remote layers before version 0.1.2. Persistent storage format has not changed.
  (`#1196 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1196>`_)
- Add skeleton for reverse engineering model. (`#1198 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1198>`_)

Bugfixes
--------

- When using ``synapse.tools.cmdr``, issuing ctrl-c to cancel a running command in could result in the Telepath Proxy object being fini'd. This has been resolved by adding a signal handler to the ``synapse.lib.cli.Cli`` class which is registered by cmdr. (`#1199 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1199>`_)
- Fix an issue where deleting a property which has no index failed. (`#1200 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1200>`_)
- Single letter form and property names were improperly disallowed.  They are now allowed. (`#1201 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1201>`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add some example developer guide documentation. (`#1193 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1193>`_)

- Remove references to ``Cortex.layer`` as a Cortex level attribute. There was no guarantee that this was the correct write layer for a arbitrary view and could lead to incorrect usage. (`#1181 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1181>`_)
- Optimize the ``snap.getNodesBy()`` API to shortcut true equality lift operations to become pure lifts by buid. (`#1183 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1183>`_)
- Add a generic Cell server, ``synapse.servers.cell`` that can be used to launch any Cell by python class path and file path.  This can be used to launch custom Cell objects. (`#1182 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1182>`_)

- Syntax parser did not allow for multiple dot hierarchies in universal properties. (`#1178 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1178>`_)
- Fix for lmdbslab mapfull error during shutdown (`#1184 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1184>`_)
- ``synapse.lib.reflect.getShareInfo()`` could return incorrect data depending on execution order and object type inheritance. (`#1186 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1186>`_)
- Add missing test for Str types extracting named regular expression matches as subs. (`#1187 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1187>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Minor documentation updates for permissions. (`#1172 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1172>`_)
