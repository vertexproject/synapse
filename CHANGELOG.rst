v2.10.0 - 2020-11-17
====================

Announcements
-------------

The ``v2.10.0`` Synapse release contains support for Python 3.8. Docker images
are now built using a Python 3.8 image by default. There are also Python 3.7
images available as ``vertexproject/synapse:master-py37`` and
``vertexproject/synapse:v2.x.x-py37``.


Features and Enhancements
-------------------------
- Python 3.8 release support for Docker and PyPi.

- Add a mechanism for Storm Services to specify commands which may require
  privilege elevation to execute. An example of this may be to allow a command
  to create nodes; without managning individual permissions on what nodes a
  user may normally be allowed to create. Services using this mechanism wiill
  use the ``storm.asroot.cmd.<<cmd name>>`` hierarchy to grant this permission.

- The ``ps:persona`` and ``ps:persona:has`` forms have been marked as
  deprecated.
  (`#1946 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1946>`_)
- Add ``ps:contactlist`` to allow collecting multiple ``ps:contact`` nodes
  together.
  (`#1935 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1935>`_)

  function could cause additional linkloop tasks to be spawned.
  (`#1924 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1924>`_)


v2.9.0 - 2020-10-19
===================

Announcements
-------------

The ``v2.9.0`` Synapse release contains an automatic Cortex Layer data
migration. The updated layer storage format reduces disk and memory
requirements for a layer. It is recommended to test this process with a
backup of a Cortex before updating a production Cortex.

In order to maximize the space savings from the new layer storage format,
after the Cortex has been migrated to ``v2.9.0``, one can take a cold
backup of the Cortex and restore the Cortex from that backup. This
compacts the LMDB databases which back the Layers and reclaims disk space
as a result. This is an optional step; as LMDB will eventually re-use the
existing space on disk.

If there are any questions about this, please reach out in the Synapse Slack
channel so we can assist with any data migration questions.

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------
- Optimize the layer storage format for memory size and performance.
  (`#1877 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1877>`_)
  (`#1885 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1885>`_)
  (`#1899 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1899>`_)
  (`#1917 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1917>`_)
- Initial support Python 3.8 compatibility for the core Synapse library.
  Additional 3.8 support (such as wheels and Docker images) will be available
  in future releases.
  (`#1907 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1907>`_)
- Add a read only Storm option to the Storm runtime. This option prevents
  executing commands or Stormtypes functions which may modify data in the
  Cortex.
  (`#1869 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1869>`_)
  (`#1916 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1916>`_)
- Allow the Telepath Dmon to disconnect clients using a ready status.
  (`#1881 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1881>`_)
- Ensure that there is only one online backup of a Cell occurring at a time.
  (`#1883 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1883>`_)
- Added ``.lower()``, ``.strip()``, ``.lstrip()`` and ``.rstrip()`` methods
  to the Stormtypes Str object. These behave like the Python ``str`` methods.
  (`#1886 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1886>`_)
  (`#1906 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1906>`_)
- When scraping text, defanged indicators are now refanged by default.
  (`#1888 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1888>`_)
- Normalize read-only property declarations to use booleans in the data model.
  (`#1887 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1887>`_)
- Add ``lift.byverb`` command to allow lifting nodes using a light edge verb.
  (`#1890 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1890>`_)
- Add netblock and range lift helpers for ``inet:ipv6`` type, similar to the
  helpers for ``inet:ipv4``.
  (`#1869 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1869>`_)
- Add a ``edges.del`` command to bulk remove light weight edges from nodes.
  (`#1893 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1893>`_)

  the Stormtypes ``Layer.pack()`` method for a layer.
  (`#1910 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1910>`_)
- Expose the remote Storm Service name in the ``$lib.service.get()``
  Stormtypes API. This allows getting a service object without knowing
  the name of the service as it was locally added to a Cortex. Also add
  a ``$lib.service.has()`` API which allows checking to see if a service
  is available on a Cortex.
  (`#1908 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1908>`_)
  (`#1915 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1915>`_)
- Add regular expression (``~=``) and prefix matching (``^=``) expression
  comparators that can be used with logical expressions inside of Storm.
  (`#1906 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1906>`_)
- Promote ``CoreApi.addFeedData()`` calls to tracked tasks which can be
  viewed and terminated.
  (`#1918 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1918>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed a Storm bug where attempting to access an undeclared variable
  silently fails. This will now raise a ``NoSuchVar`` exception. This
  is verified at runtime, not at syntax evaluation.
  (`#1916 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1916>`_)
- Ensure that Storm HTTP APIs tear down the runtime task if the remote
  disconnects before consuming all of the messages.
  (`#1889 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1889>`_)

  in greedy CPU use.
  (`#1902 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1902>`_)
- When pivoting across light edges, if the destination form was not a valid
  form, nothing happened. Now a StormRuntimeError is raised if the
  destination form is not valid.
  (`#1905 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1905>`_)
- Fix an issue with spawn processes accessing lmdb databases after a slab
  resize event has occurred by the main process.
  (`#1914 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1914>`_)

  for a Cell.
  (`#1873 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1873>`_)
- Add support for a environment variable, ``SYN_LOCKMEM_DISABLE`` which will
  disable any memory locking of LMDB slabs.
  (`#1882 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1882>`_)

Deprecations
------------

- The ``0.1.x`` to ``2.x.x`` Migration tool and and associated Cortex sync
  service will be removed from Synapse in the ``2.9.0`` release. In order to
  move forward to ``2.9.0``, please make sure that any Cortexes which still
  need to be migrated will first be migrated to ``2.8.x`` prior to attempting
  to use ``2.9.x``.

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Add Synapse README content to the Pypi page. This was a community
  contribution from https://github.com/wesinator.  (`#1872
  <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1872>`_)


v2.7.3 - 2020-09-16
===================

Deprecations
------------
- The ``0.1.x`` to ``2.x.x`` Migration tool and and associated Cortex sync service will be removed from Synapse in
  the ``2.9.0`` release. In order to move forward to ``2.9.0``, please make sure that any Cortexes which still need to
  be migrated will first be migrated to ``2.8.x`` prior to attempting to use ``2.9.x``.
  (`#1880 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1880>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Remove duplicate words in a comment. This was a community contribution from enadjoe.
  (`#1874 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1874>`_)
- Fix a nested Nexus log event in Storm Service deletion. The ``del`` event causing Storm code execution could lead to
  nested Nexus events, which is incongruent with how Nexus change handlers work. This now spins off the Storm code in
  a free-running coroutine. This does change the service ``del`` semantics since any support Storm packages a service
  had may be removed by the time the handler executes.
  (`#1876 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1876>`_)
- Fix an issue where the ``cull`` parameter was not being passed to the multiqueue properly when calling ``.gets()``
  on a Storm Types Queue object.
  (`#1876 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1876>`_)
- Pin the ``nbconvert`` package to a known working version, as ``v6.0.0`` of that package broke the Synapse document
  generation by changing how templates work.
  (`#1876 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1876>`_)
- Correct ``min`` and ``max`` integer examples in tagprop documentation and tests.
  (`#1878 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1878>`_)


v2.7.2 - 2020-09-04

- Update tests for additional test code coverage. This was a community contribution from blackout.
  (`#1867 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1867>`_)
- Add implicit links to documentation generated for Storm services, to allow for direct linking inside of documentation
  to specific Storm commands.
  (`#1866 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1866>`_)
- Add future support for deprecating model elements in the Synapse data model. This support will produce client and
  server side warnings when deprecated model elements are used or loaded by custom model extensions or CoreModules.
  (`#1863 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1863>`_)

Bugfixes
--------
- Update ``FixedCache.put()`` to avoid a cache miss. This was a community contribution from blackout.
  (`#1868 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1868>`_)
- Fix the ioloop construction to be aware of ``SYN_GREEDY_CORO`` environment variable to put the ioloop into debug mode
  and log long-running coroutines.
  (`#1870 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1870>`_)
- Fix how service permissions are checked in ``$lib.service.get()`` and ``$lib.service.wait()`` Storm library calls.
  These APIs now first check ``service.get.<service iden>`` before checking ``service.get.<service name>`` permissions.
  A successful ``service.get.<service name>`` check will result in a warning to the client and the server.
  (`#1871 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1871>`_)

  trying to open files in the directory.
  (`#1860 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/issues/1860>`_)
  (`#1861 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1861>`_)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
- Fix an incorrect statement in our documentation about the intrinsic Axon that a Cortex creates being remotely
  accessible.

  the ``syn:cmd`` runt nodes.
  (`#1850 <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/pull/1850>`_)
- Add package level configuration data to Storm Packages in the ``modconf`` value of a package definition. This is added
  to the runtime variables when a Storm package is imported, and includes the ``svciden`` for packages which come from
  Storm Services.
